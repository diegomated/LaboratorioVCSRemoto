/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

        [&#34;For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You&#39;d think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer&#39;s assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There&#39;s a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey&#39;s Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he&#39;s reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O&#39;Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU&#39;s brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season&#39;s dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There&#39;s no comfort level at all here, as you&#39;re never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru &#39;em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five&#39;s finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack&#39;s estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can&#39;t wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!&#34;,
         &#39;Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of &#34;prisoner\&#39;s rights&#34; and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O\&#39;Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that\&#39;s happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it\&#39;s still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!&#39;,
         &#34;In the aftermath of season 4, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had to fake his own death and go into hiding.  But he can&#39;t seem to stay in retirement for long.  Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends, forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.Meanwhile, it is an important day for the United States and President Logan (Gregory Itzin).  He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don&#39;t remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer&#39;s desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can&#39;t anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.  I&#39;m counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again.&#34;,
         &#34;I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I&#39;ve watched it over three times and I can&#39;t wait.&#34;,
         &#39;&#34;24&#34; is like Red Bull--once you\&#39;ve had it you\&#39;re addicted. The fifth season of &#34;24&#34; revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It\&#39;s a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched &#34;Casino Royale&#34; its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like &#34;24&#34; which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven\&#39;t seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode &#34;prequel&#34; to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There\&#39;s also a summary of the season included as well athough if you\&#39;ve watched the show (or are watching it now) it won\&#39;t really provide anything new. Th &#34;100 Episode Reel&#34; is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven\&#39;t had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season.&#39;,
         &#34;At the close of the fourth season of the Shield, there was reason for celebration.  As season five begins, not much seems to have changed.  Corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team are back together again, Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) is in prison, Rawling is gone, Aceveda (Benito Martinez) seems out of reach; it seems like it&#39;s business as usual.  Then everything changes.  Enter Forest Whitaker as Jon Kavanaugh, an IAD lieutenant who is making it his sole purpose in life to bring Vic down.  His method: using Lem (Kenny Johnson) as a blackmail tactic to rat out Vic.  But as we learn as the season progresses, not only do things not go as planned, but everything comes to a shocker of a conclusion that will have you beating the walls in anticipation for the sixth season.  Also going on during the season are a variety of things: Julian (Michael Jace) breaks in a new partner (Paula Garces) because Danny (Catherine Dent) is pregnant, Wyms (CCH Pounder) looks to take another shot at being the Captain, and Shane (Walt Goggins) makes a choice that will alter the course of the show forever.  As the credits roll after the season finale, it is clear that the end is quite near, which is bittersweet in a way, because if it&#39;s one thing that Shawn Ryan&#39;s gritty cop drama has proved, it&#39;s that prime time cable TV can be nothing less than spectacular.&#34;,
         &#39;My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been &#34;The Sopranos&#34; and &#34;The Shield.&#34;  As &#34;The Sopranos&#34; limps into its final season--let\&#39;s face it, that show hasn\&#39;t had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons--&#34;The Shield&#34; is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning.  The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I can\&#39;t wait to see where they\&#39;re going with this!&#39;,
         &#34;There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE.  There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week&#39;s episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa&#39;uld.  The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer.  But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better.  All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale.  Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one.  The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised.  Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times.  My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode.  If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget.  I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha&#39;s father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok&#39;ra, a group rebel Goa&#39;uld opposed to the regular Goa&#39;uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam&#39;s father is dying of cancer and the Tok&#39;ra Selmak&#39;s host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam&#39;s father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can&#39;t understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen.  Although I&#39;ve never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.&#34;,
         &#39;It\&#39;s been a few years now, and I haven\&#39;t heard that theme song on the radio since forever. But, as more and more time pass from when Friends ended, I find myself popping my Friends dvd collection in my player on a regular basis. Despite some promising television shows currently on air, there\&#39;s still no substitution for Friends. To be honest, I now can\&#39;t stand watching the Friends episodes when shown on TBS or the WB because of the commercials and the shortened scenes.Friends: The Complete Tenth Season is a shortened season, only having 17 episodes. The famous cast, immersed in other acting projects, still found enough time in their hectic schedule to put together a fitting capper on what has been an all-time classic sitcom. Thru the course of season 10, we witness the ascension and abrupt demise of the Rachel-Joey romance, the end of Ross\&#39;s relationship with Charlie, Monica and Chandler\&#39;s struggles to adopt a baby, Phoebe\&#39;s marriage, Phoebe\&#39;s choice of her new name (Princess Consuela Banana-Hammock) and Mike\&#39;s retaliatory new monicker (Crapbag - first name &#34;Crap,&#34; last name &#34;Bag&#34;), Chandler and Monica\&#39;s decision to move to the suburbs, Rachel\&#39;s new job offer, and, at last, the resolution of the Ross and Rachel off-again, on-again romance.There\&#39;s really no need to go into the outstanding chemistry of the regulars. The cast is luminous and knowing that this is the last season lends a certain bittersweet tang to their acting. A few standout scenes for me: Swhimmer\&#39;s hilarious performances in &#34;The One Where Ross is Fine&#34; and &#34;The One with Ross\&#39;s Tan,&#34; Matt Perry\&#39;s heartfelt speech to Erica at the end of &#34;The One with the Birth Mother,&#34; and the whole cast\&#39;s emotional performance in &#34;The One with Rachel\&#39;s Going Away Party&#34; and &#34;The Last One.&#34;Some episodes did disappoint. I didn\&#39;t find Danny DeVito particularly funny in &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries&#34; while &#34;The One with the Late Thanksgiving&#34; did not live up to the quality of the other classic Thanksgiving episodes.The reassuring, always welcome presences of Elliot Gould, Christina Pickles, Maggie Wheeler, Giovanni Ribisi, and Paul Rudd are felt as they all show up for a final bow, while the unheralded James Michael Tyler as Gunther finally reveals his affections for Rachel. The guest stars are ho-hum this time. Christina Applegate (not as memorable here as her last stint), Dakota Fanning, Selma Blair, Greg Kinnear, Danny DeVito, and Aisha Tyler don\&#39;t particularly contribute anything of note to the proceedings. However, Anna Faris is great as the pregnant, kinda clueless Erica, while Jennifer Coolidge is funny enough in her role as the obnoxious Amanda Buffamonteezi that she got a regular role in Joey.This time, there\&#39;s no shortchanging the special features: teary-eyed episode commentary by the producers and director on &#34;The One  with the Late Thanksgiving,&#34; &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries,&#34; and &#34;The Last One.&#34; The 4th disc is devoted entirely to extra features: Friends Final Thoughts: the cast and producers reflect during their final days at work and after series production ends, Gag Reels for Seasons 1-4 and Season 10, Friends of Friends video guestbook with Aisha Tyler, Paul Rudd, and Christina Applegate, a Joey Joey music video, and a short cast &amp; crew list.I grew up on Friends, which to this day continues to be my &#34;comfort food&#34; of television. And to this day, I still miss these six characters. When I\&#39;m bored or feeling down, I pop in any one of the 10 seasons and my mood inevitably improves. I can\&#39;t help but feel that, somewhere, Ross and Rachel, Monica and Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are still hanging out together, hanging out with friends.&#39;,
         &#34;Awesome show, but does it bother anybody else that most historical shows always have Brits and their accents? Come on, I&#39;d like to see more Americans in shows that are taped, produced and marketed here, call it a plea for the actors I know here. In reality if America is the modern likeness of Rome then it makes much more sense as well. I wonder what the Romans would sound like? Maybe Italian/Greek accent seems feasible. Anyways it&#39;s a good show, I just get sick of the whole British thing.&#34;,
         &#34;The time honored historical novel formula of placing the story of invented characters against the backdrop of major events is used to good effect in the HBO production Rome. The story follows two Roman soldiers, straight arrow Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and his act now--think later friend Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson), through the power struggle that ends with the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. Their adventures and rocky romances are by far the most engaging of the series.It all starts when Pullo prays to be reprieved from prison and a death sentence, only to have the cell door open minutes later with orders that he help his commanding officer search for an eagle standard stolen from Caesar. The quest takes a surprising turn and along the way the disciplined soldier and his disorderly companion begin to build a friendship.The blockbuster style scripting proves that even prurient interest can be a bore. Atia&#39;s (Polly Walker) machinations are carried off with aplomb, but other scenes meant to titillate often created more yawns than lust. Little gems like Cicero&#39;s (David Bamber) witty remarks, Octavian&#39;s (Max Pirkis) logic, and Pompey&#39;s (Kenneth Cranham) pithy description of how his battle with Caesar (Ciaran Hinds) was lost show how much better the script might have been.The costuming and sets are marvelous and certainly deserve the nominations they garnered, but also watch for the little moments of Roman life like a glassblower working in his street-side shop. All in all, the DVD provides pleasant sit back and relax viewing, but if this soapy glimpse of ancient Rome left you wanting a main course try reading Steven Saylor&#39;s excellent mystery series set in the same time frame.&#34;,
         &#39;Being a student and author of historical fiction, I must say the British production companies do &#34;history&#34; better than anyone else. &#34;Rome&#34; is an outstanding production with well done story lines.The writers developed well-known, but rarely published facts about common Roman life; graffiti, treatment of slaves--and the love of blood. The realism is sometimes a bit &#34;raw&#34;--but accurate historically. Greeks loved beauty--Romans loved blood.The casting is excellent and the props superb! I first noticed Max Pirkis in &#34;Master and Commander&#34; (One of my favorite movies) and think the boy has a lot of talent. He is growing into adult roles well and we will see him in some excellent thought provoking roles--if his parents can protect him from &#34;Hollywood.&#34;Well done Brits! (American studios should be jealous!)&#39;,
         &#34;HBO takes risks, thank goodness, and this series ROME  is a fine example of how far a television project can go toward the movie industry and still maintain interest when broken into weekly installments.  There may be a number of quibbles from Latin scholars and historians as to the veracity of it all, but ROME is not a documentary: ROME is a novel played out in Grand Guignol fashion with a sterling cast and a creative production crew.The action takes place in 52 BC and allows us to understand the power struggles and changes of influence between Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham) who leads the Senate, and Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds).  Caesar has returned from his Gallic wars supported by his soldiers such as Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and his somewhat unfaithful wife Niobe (Indira Varma) and Lucius&#39; best friend (and philosophically polar opposite) Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  But the populace and Senate have formed other ideas during Caesar&#39;s prolonged absence at war and all manner of intrigues surface, are planned, and are plotted.There is a generous (some would say excessive) amount of violence and sex spattered about, but then when in Rome....  Some of the supporting cast are particularly fine: Polly Walker is more beautiful (and more evil) than ever as Atia and other small roles are graciously filled with superb actors.The distractions from the series include the ever-present town crier who periodically catches us up on the history as a media newspaper person in toga.  And the opening credits are animated grafitti that become silly and tiresome.  But the overall production values are first class and the color of the cinematography is some of the finest seen on television.  It is a long song, but it can be taken in digestible pieces.  Well worth viewing for a different view of Rome in all its squalid splendor.  Grady Harp, August 06&#34;,
         &#34;Rome, HBO&#39;s ambitious, and expensive, series revolving around the events leading up to the assassination of Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds), is a sight to behold.  Created and filmed by a plethora of talented individuals (including legendary film maverick John Milius), Rome is brought to life with a fantastic set design that must be seen to be believed; it&#39;s as if the city is breathing.  The story follows two of Caesar&#39;s soldiers (Ray Stevenson and Trainspotting&#39;s Kevin McKidd) who find themselves throughout many events in Roman history, beginning with inadvertantly rescuing Octavian (Max Pirkis), being lost at sea, assisting Cleopatra (in more than one way, this episode will leave you laughing) and Caesar&#39;s struggle with Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham).  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Rome is everything you&#39;d come to expect from an HBO series: rich characterizations, an engrossing story, and a superbly assembled, large cast (including James Purefoy as Marc Antony, Kerry Condon, and Polly Walker as the scheming Atia), Rome is compulsively addictive viewing, made even more so by the climax and of the season finale, which will have you begging for more.&#34;,
         &#39;&#34;Lucius Vorenus: It makes no sense. We should have been stopped by now. Why is Rome not defended?Titus Pullo: Our boys scared \&#39;em off, eh?Lucius Vorenus: Soldiers of the Republic do not run, so it must be a stratagem, a trick.Titus Pullo: It\&#39;s a good trick.Lucius Vorenus: Unless the gods have abandoned Rome... If Mars were watching, he would not allow such a disgrace.Titus Pullo: Maybe he was havin\&#39; a crap and missed it.&#34;Sex, dancing girls, severed heads, gallows humour, four-letter words, strong women, and power displays are all to the fore in this marvelous series. &#34;Rome&#34; came on like a lamb, stole our hearts and minds and went out like a Lion. A series like no other. This is a story about a great man, Julius Caesar, played by Ciaaran Hinds, glorious and handsome man. We came to praise him and we do. We come to like Julius Caesar and we know what is to come. He is a benevolent leader and mixes with the local soldier group.  The standout characters are two of Caesar\&#39;s soldiers, Lucius Vorenus played by Kevin McKidd and Titus Pullo played by Ray Stevenson. They are real people, have real hearts and minds and can suffer along with the rest of us.&#34;Rome&#34; is a 100 million dollar HBO series. The scenes are glorious, depravity and lusty and dirty. We are privy to the real sex and feelings of the characters and what a group they are. We come to like most of them. The costuming is marvelous, 4,000 pieces of wardrobe were made or found. The scenery is fabulous- the olive trees in the Sacred Grove of the Forum set are over 200 years old. It is this kind of thing, maybe small in the realm of things, but this is what makes up the gloriousness of this series, &#34;Rome&#34;. I absolutely loved it and was glued to the TV and watched each episode several times.&#34;Rome&#34; has been nominated for several awards and justly deserves each one:BAFTA Awards: BAFTA TV Award for Best Production Design, Best Visual Effects, Best TitlesCinema Audio Society, USA: C.A.S. Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Television SeriesEmmy Awards: Emmy for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music, Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)Golden Globes, USA: Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Drama, Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - DramaSatellite Awards: Satellite Award for Outstanding Television Series, Drama, Outstanding Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TelevisionWriters Guild of America, USA: WGA Award (TV) for New Series&#34;Rome&#34; began as a mystery. We knew how it should end, but the in-between was such a joy to behold. The acting, the story, the scenery, the costumes, the brutality, the political intrigue, the characters who come to life, drag us in. You can\&#39;t help it, you love these people, you don\&#39;t want the series to end. It does, but it is only Part One. &#34;Rome&#34;, Part Two is to come, and it is enough to keep us going, waiting. Sweetie and I will be waiting.Lucius Vorenus: Do you think of *nothing* but women?Titus Pullo: What else is there?[he thinks]Titus Pullo: Food, I s\&#39;pose.Very Highly Recommended. prisrob 8-05-06&#39;,
         &#39;The best historical drama produced about the Roman Empire since &#34;I, Claudius&#34; and much more action driven &#34;Rome&#34; positively bristles with energy, a brilliant production design and stunning direction to compliment the strong scripts. &#34;Rome&#34; has every bit the look of a theatrical film with all the epic grandeur one could hope for. The first episode directed by Michael Apted and written by Bruno Heller (&#34;Touching Evil&#34; provides viewers with a context for the series. Set in 52 A.D. &#34;Rome&#34; chronicles the fall of Pompey (Kenneth Cranham)and the rise of Gaius Caesar (Ciar&amp;aacute;n Hinds) and how it impacts two &#34;ordinary soldiers&#34; Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd from &#34;Kingdom of Heaven&#34;) and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson &#34;King Arthur&#34; and the TV show &#34;Waking the Dead&#34;). Their lives are entwined with Caesar and the change of Rome from a Republic to an Empire that is ultimately ruled over by Octavian. As we first meet Caesar he has conquered the Gauls but at his victory Gaius receives devastating news; his daughter and Pompey\&#39;s wife died during childbirth while he conquers the north. Suddenly the tenuous strands that bound these former allies and friends together have been cut. Pompey claims he won\&#39;t betray a friend but makes plans behind the scenes to support his position. Many in the Roman Senate are concerned that Caesar\&#39;s great victories will allow him to wrest control from Pompey. The nobles in the Senate convince Pompey to betray his friend Caesar and undermine his reputation before his return to prevent him from possibly taking control of the Republic.Great performances, top notch production values and writing make this show as distinctive as &#34;Deadwood&#34; and &#34;The Sopranos&#34; in their prime.The price is high so the packaging, extras and look of the show better be top notch. It is. Packaged in a hard box the packging appears pretty darn sturdy and when you open it there are images from the series. As usual HBO provides an exceptional transfer with bright vivid colors and deep, rich blacks. I didn\&#39;t detect any major digital flaws and analog flaws are nonexistent. The 5.1 audio mix is marvelous filled with detail and flawless sounding.We get eight commentary tracks including producer/writer and creator Bruno Heller along with a mix of actors and crew. Four also feature historical consultant Jonathan Stamp who also provides a historical text commentary that crops up from time to time with fascinating tidbits. If you think divorce is a problem in our culture wait until you find out how often the Roman\&#39;s divorced. Both provide quite a bit of history and production trivia about shooting the series although there are long stretches of silence they more than make up for these with their lively discussion when they do talk. There are a number of terrific featurettes on Roman society and the production of the series but the best as far as I was concerned (outsome of the commentary track on the first episode, I haven\&#39;t had a chance to listen to the others yet)is the text commentary with historical facts. When they pop up you can push enter on your remote and be taken to a page of further text and information on Roman society. These pop up quite often and provide both historical facts and also background about some of the events and things referred to in the dialog. My only complaint and it is that when you hit return after reading the page sometimes it will take you back to the beginning of the episode vs. returning you to the point you were at. Perhaps this is a flaw in the set I got or a problem with my DVD player (I actually watched it on my computer). I\&#39;m not sure.We get five featurettes that are scattered throughout the set with the bulk of the special features on the sixth disc. First up is &#34;Friends, Romans and Countrymen&#34; which gives those unfamiliar with Roman history the background on the main characters and all the shenanigans they were up to without spoiling the plot.Another great HBO series, &#34;Rome&#34; is both involving drama and also full of spectacular action sequences. The performances by the actors are all strong. Highly recommended. If you can\&#39;t buy it rent it you\&#39;ll enjoy it.&#39;],

        [&#34;Who says the sitcom is dead?  Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don&#39;t know what to expect next.  It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there&#39;s nothing really wholly original about the show&#39;s premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.  The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee&#39;s father, who isn&#39;t the sanest of the bunch either.  This DVD set compiles the first two seasons of the show, and is definitely worth picking up for viewers who turned it when it first premiered, as well as newer viewers who may be anxiously awaiting the upcoming and long awaited third season of this very funny show.&#34;,
         &#34;This is a banner series for this extraordinarily conceived and executed television series.  From its explosive opening through 24 hours of plot twists, exciting action, and devastating loss, this season is absolutely superb.  Be warned though---there&#39;s lots of unexpected killings in this season and several favorite characters are disposed of.  You just don&#39;t know what to expect from this Emmy-winning series.Kiefer Sutherland won his much deserved Best Actor emmy as Jack finds himself confronted with one impossible task after another.  The supporting cast is superb:  James Morrison as CTU director Bill Buchanan; Mary Lynn Rajskub as the neurotic but brilliant Chloe; Kim Raver as Jack&#39;s former love Audrey; William Devane as irasible Secretary of Defense; Louis Lombardi as the plump and human Edgar; Jayne Atkinson as the Homeland Security Director; Sean Astin as the pompous replacement; Peter Weller as the vicious assassin; Glenn Morshower as the stoic Aaron; Jude Ciccollella as Mike Novick; Julian Sands as the evil terrorist; and of course, Gregory Itzin and Jean Smart as the President and First Lady, who were robbed of their supporting actor Emmys, and who are just fantastic in these pivotal roles.24 is one of the best series out there and this season shows why.&#34;,
         &#39;Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn\&#39;t let up until it\&#39;s over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they\&#39;ve added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn\&#39;t completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don\&#39;t have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can\&#39;t test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn\&#39;t notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I\&#39;ve noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn\&#39;t say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn\&#39;t seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you\&#39;ll probably like 24 as well. There are some &#34;intense&#34; scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.&#39;,
         &#39;Season Five was the winner!  Of course, Kiefer and the regular cast absolutely rock, it was fantastic to see as much of Agent Pierce as we did this season, and Gregory Itzen and Jean Smart...... well, what can I say about them other than === shoulda won the Emmys!!!&#39;,
         &#34;The shocking opening moments of the fifth season of 24 literally blew away everything that we&#39;ve come to know about the show.  Alliances are challenged, close friends are lost--all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.The cast is perfect, the storyline is compelling, and the action is never ceasing.  This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10&#34;,
         &#34;What happened with Tony and the plague he was dying from.  HELP!  It&#39;s killing me to know!!!!!!!!!!&#34;,
         &#39;NCIS changed in third season..and gotten strongerAt the end of season two, Kate was shot and died. Season three handles her death in the openning two parter &#34;Kill Ari&#34; which also introduces the audience to Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) and the new NCIS director (Lauren Holly).The change comes in many ways, Gibbs seems harder after Kate\&#39;s death and it shows during the season, which builds to the two part season finale &#34;Hiatus&#34;...a cliffehanger to open season four. all the character grew from Abby, Ducky, Mcgee and especially Tony.Most say change is bad, for this show is GOOD and we the audience reap the benifitsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD&#39;,
         &#39;It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate\&#39;s murder from Ari\&#39;s POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part &#34;Kill Ari&#34; episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn\&#39;t been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate\&#39;s ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, &#34;Kill Ari&#34; allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo\&#39;s Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate\&#39;s death and Lauren Holly\&#39;s Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs\&#39; former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director\&#39;s job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon\&#39;s &#34;tough, no-nonsense investigator&#34; (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the &#34;Kill Ari&#34; episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro\&#39;s background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate\&#39;s murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of &#34;Under Covers&#34;, his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the &#34;Hiatus&#34; two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs\&#39; painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly\&#39;s Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (&#34;Bait&#34;), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn\&#39;t had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in &#34;Probie&#34;, when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray\&#39;s Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn\&#39;t it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show\&#39;s many trademarks?).  Plus, there\&#39;s whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it\&#39;s with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby\&#39;s lab when she\&#39;s mainlining the &#34;Kaff-Pow&#34; or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby\&#39;s ability with duct tape (&#34;Frame Up&#34;) and her temper in general (&#34;Bloodbath&#34;).David McCallum\&#39;s Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters\&#39; major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky\&#39;s mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she\&#39;s visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly\&#39;s character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs\&#39; relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren\&#39;t privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn\&#39;t know the whole story (Until &#34;Hiatus&#34;).The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony\&#39;s vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin\&#39;s Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari\&#39;s storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs\&#39; McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It\&#39;s always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario\&#39;s turn as Abby\&#39;s lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can\&#39;t forget Muse Watson\&#39;s introduction in the &#34;Hiatus&#34; episodes as Gibbs\&#39; mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks\&#39; amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it\&#39;s beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season.&#39;,
         &#39;This serries is OK, but it really lacks the substance that Criminal Minds, MI-5, CSI or Alias has.  The list goes on. When is the second season of Bones and Criminal Minds coming out?&#39;,
         &#34;What a morose way to end such a fun series. I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously, it would come to a bad end, and I was right. It&#39;s like, we&#39;re ending the season with no sense of humor. In fact, we&#39;re gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we&#39;re going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T&#39;ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!). Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment. What a shame. Maybe that&#39;s why this season is going for $29! I&#39;d rather buy two copies of Season 1! How do I pick zero stars?&#34;,
         &#34;Always buy this series, and am sorry that it is, as a weekly show, ending.Therefore it is good to be able to have the last season (I have all the others) as it is one of the best in the field - science fiction - apart from old faithful Star Trek. Always miss Richard Dean Anderson, that wry and handsome wit, but Shanks and Browder, let alone Claudia Black, what a terrific actor! more than make up for his loss. I always wish more of Amanda Tapping&#39;s abilities apart from sheer mathematics that she is forced by plot to come out with at least four or five times per episode could be utilized in more interesting directions, but she is the greatest also. Look forward to her in Stargate Atlantis.Stargate SG-1 season 10 is a worthy product and has been added to my collection with great satisfaction.Linda Sheean&#34;,
         &#39;Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show\&#39;s legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can\&#39;t point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids\&#39; show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I\&#39;m a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn\&#39;t mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black\&#39;s real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I\&#39;ve long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson\&#39;s Jack O\&#39;Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O\&#39;Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black\&#39;s Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season\&#39;s opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha\&#39;s father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok\&#39;ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I\&#39;m sure there was the temptation of a &#34;Big Ending,&#34; but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal\&#39;c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn\&#39;t the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn\&#39;t the most ground breaking.  And it isn\&#39;t likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used &#34;Science as Magic&#34; to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\&#39;s refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.&#39;,
         &#34;In case you aren&#39;t familiar with the show, this is the final season DVD set.It&#39;s a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it&#39;s really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown. What you discover is fascinating, exciting and dangerous; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I&#39;ve been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes.  This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction.  I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I&#39;m sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it&#39;s Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show.&#34;,
         &#39;and everything in between during the 10th season of &#34;Stargate: SG-1&#34;. By the way, this ISN\&#39;T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from &#34;Farscape&#34;)and Vala (Claudia Black anther &#34;Farscape&#34; alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on &#34;The X-Files&#34; and &#34;Farscape&#34; these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time &#34;Farscape&#34; fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O\&#39;Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis\&#39; character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on &#34;Star Trek: Voyager&#34; started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won\&#39;t notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I\&#39;m sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director\&#39;s Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies &#34;Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth&#34; (the second one also coming in 2008 is &#34;Stargate SG-1: Continuum&#34; involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it\&#39;s a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy.&#39;,
         &#39;Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved.&#39;,
         &#39;I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.Here\&#39;s why.(Warning!  Spoilers below!)First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn\&#39;t happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn\&#39;t seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I\&#39;m dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the &#34;weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other&#34;.  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode &#34;The Naked Time&#34; and wasn\&#39;t it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of &#34;ancients&#34; just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the &#34;ancients&#34; have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn\&#39;t an &#34;ancient&#34; or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn\&#39;t that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There\&#39;s so much that could have been done with them that wasn\&#39;t.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there\&#39;s Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he\&#39;s still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there\&#39;s the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven\&#39;t seen any of season four.  Here\&#39;s hoping.&#39;,
         &#39;Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I\&#39;ve watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I\&#39;m convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I\&#39;m not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they\&#39;ve been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett\&#39;s leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I\&#39;m anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series\&#39; run.  If you don\&#39;t have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in &#34;Common Ground,&#34; in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal\&#39;c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won\&#39;t know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.&#39;,
         &#34;Good series  Very happy that William Fitchner joined the crew. He&#39;s such a good actor and adds a lot to the show.&#34;,
         &#34;From beginning to end of season 2 Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) are on the run from the police and government agents that want them dead. The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren&#39;t messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that&#39;s not all that makes this guy a threat....he&#39;s extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield&#39;s next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he&#39;s going to find next. I was hoping he&#39;d find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don&#39;t wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He&#39;s a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows&#39; name. So there&#39;s a lot of character development going on in this season. There&#39;s a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it&#39;s always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it&#39;s not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It&#39;s always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It&#39;s really a must see!&#34;,
         &#39;The first season of &#34;Prison Break&#34; was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I\&#39;m going to get this out of the way right now, it\&#39;s not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It\&#39;s still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David &#34;Tweener&#34; Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who\&#39;s had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore &#34;T-Bag&#34; Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin &#34;C-Note&#34; Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they &#34;Fox River 8&#34; begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist &amp; pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don\&#39;t want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven\&#39;t even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they\&#39;ve only got better at playing the roles. They\&#39;re gotten under their character\&#39;s skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn\&#39;t as smart as season 1...There\&#39;s many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael\&#39;s tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer\&#39;s can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There\&#39;s no way that Haywire could\&#39;ve remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven\&#39;t jumped on the &#34;Prison Break&#34; bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can\&#39;t wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you\&#39;ve found something special...And &#34;Prison Break&#34; is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I\&#39;m going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A&#39;,
         &#34;As the second season of Prison Break opens, things get moving along rather quickly.  Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers&#39; trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it&#39;s break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you&#39;ll be salivating for more.&#34;,
         &#34;Breaking out of prison is one thing.  Dealing with the inevitable and complicated fallout and consequences afterwards is another.In the second season of this series, the characters discover just how hard it is to regain a normal life, a life not spent on the run.  C-Note has a wife and sickly daughter who suffer to a degree because of him and he nearly kills himself.  T-Bag&#39;s twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home, but he doesn&#39;t face reality.  Bellick thinks he can find the money but ends up imprisoned in a foreign country and has left Sucre&#39;s beloved woman locked up somewhere.Haywire ends up dead, as does Tweener, while Mahone and others involved in the conspiracy and the hunt create their own hell.Scofield and Burrows try to hide out in Panama with Sarah, but all goes asunder and Scofield is now in the hellish prison of that country.In such a bleak world, it&#39;s amazing that any of these people keep trying to carve out a life for themselves.&#34;,
         &#39;Just finished watching it - bought the UK version last week.Good but not as good as season one.Some lame weak writing there.More like a fugitive show than the very unique original first season.Great acting again from Michael, Linc and the crewPlus some good actionso I recommend buying it&#39;,
         &#34;I hadn&#39;t watched Bones until I picked up the first season on DVD when I was looking for something different to watch. Now it&#39;s one of my favorite shows--much more fun than CSI, a little gross at times, but over all one of the best shows on the tube right now.&#34;,
         &#39;Better than the first.  Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations.  Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition.  You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much. The writing is still excellent and holds your attention. Looking forward to the new season and more cases.&#39;,
         &#39;I loved this season of Bones even more than season one, as more of the cast are developing to fuller characters, with new subplots to keep things tied together, and more really cool forensics.Dr Brennan (Emily Deschanel) continues to struggle with her desire to feel normal emotional connection, while her intellect keeps her from exactly getting there, and while the chemical tension with her partner simmers under the surface. Thrown into the mix are new moral dilemmas due to her developing knowledge of her birth family, and shades of gray start to infiltrate her world of black and white. Can one be a moral (justified) killer? Etc. Forgiveness and love are examined in rather unique waysBones is very good TV, that I can enjoy with both my wife and my teens.So if you have already watched season one, get season two (but really, watch one first for the character development that is quite good) and have a marathon fun weekend!&#39;,
         &#39;O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here\&#39;s Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there\&#39;s no slack off at all from season one\&#39;s most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance &#34;Bones&#34; Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television\&#39;s most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones\&#39; supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There\&#39;s a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn\&#39;t keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth\&#39;s: &#34;Keep talking. I\&#39;ll catch up.&#34; The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season\&#39;s newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O\&#39;Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan\&#39;s new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we\&#39;re hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother\&#39;s unsolved murder and her father\&#39;s disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are &#34;The Truth in the Lye&#34; (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: &#34;Even for me, this is disgusting.&#34;), &#34;The Woman in the Sand&#34; (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), &#34;Aliens in a Spaceship&#34; (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking &#34;The Blonde in the Game&#34; and its equally harrowing follow-up &#34;The Man in the Cell&#34; features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season\&#39;s &#34;A Man on Death Row&#34;) and the season-ender &#34;Stargazer in the Puddle&#34; (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on &#34;The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House&#34; (with Emily Deschanel) and on &#34;Stargazer in a Puddle.&#34; Boreanaz doesn\&#39;t commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers &#34;The Memories in the Season&#34; featurette; &#34;Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones&#34; featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on &#34;The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House&#34; reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there\&#39;ll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).&#39;,
         &#34;Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect, partly due to the real geekiness of its actors, it was a pleasure to watch. Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series. Boreanaz&#39; stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely. Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time. These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season.&#34;,
         &#39;Fortunately, the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves. Also, the additon of a new female head chief (Cam)for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely. This, adding to intriguing plots, superb support roles by Ryan O\&#39;Neil and Stephen Fry, scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes (the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes!)and the &#34;love angle&#34; with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television.&#39;,
         &#39;Season 2 explores the relationship and the background of the show\&#39;s characters. Their relationships are tested by trials, tribulations, killers trying to get them and trying to save each other. This is a really good show. It is well written, interesting and captivating. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have great on-screen chemistry. Dechanel portrays &#34;Bones&#34; very well. She is quirky in all the right ways.&#39;,
         &#39;Building on the momentum of its first season, this Fox series continues successfully combining the morbidity of forensic investigation with the intrigue of budding office romances.Spicing things up, an old girlfriend of Booth\&#39;s, Dr. Camile \&#39;Cam\&#39; Saroyan (Tamara Taylor) becomes Dr. Brennan\&#39;s boss (&#34;The Titan on the Tracks&#34;). Initially uncertain they can work together, they soon hammer out a workplace agreement, creating a truce.Ironically, this hard-nosed boss\&#39;s life later becomes endangered after she inhales a toxin in &#34;The Man in the Cell&#34;. It creates a little drama in the workplace--and for viewing audiences--while she is recovering.Booth also has a personal problem of his own to deal with during this season His ex-girlfriend is letting her new boyfriend spend time with their son--whom he is very protective of (&#34;Mother and Child in the Bay&#34;). Boreanaz does some of his most convincing acting as the \&#39;concerned parent of a young child\&#39;. I am shocked that the writers of this series haven\&#39;t promoted it through more balance of Booth\&#39;s parenting.&#34;The Girl With the Curl&#34; obviously drew it\&#39;s inspiration from the still-unsolved Jon Benet Ramsey case. Brennan and Booth have to figure out who killed a child beauty queen before tragedy strikes again, and are visibly concerned. They\&#39;ve seen all kinds of stuff on this job, but learning what children undergo to be considered \&#39;pretty\&#39; really pushes their limits. They are further surprised to discover the actual identity of the killer.&#39;,
         &#34;This show got even better in its second season, with the arrival of the tough new Cam as the boss of the squints, the wonderful Stephen Fry appearing as Booth&#39;s psychiatrist, Angela and Hodgins falling in love, and wonderboy Zach being promoted and getting a new haircut in the process.  The characters and the show are really coming into their own now.  I look forward to season 3.&#34;,
         &#34;The first couple of episodes weren&#39;t the best but overall, it is a good series. It kinda looks like they are just putting something together to have a show on a couple of the episodes. That is my only negative. A couple of the old case files came back into the picture and the bad guy comes to justice. I love it when they do that!Another good season for Miami:CSI!&#34;,
         &#34;I don&#39;t have television, haven&#39;t for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I&#39;ve purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows.&#34;,
         &#39;Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than &#34;The Season Of Secrets&#34; as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the &#34;Probie&#34;, Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro\&#39;s return from Mexico isn\&#39;t exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard\&#39;s indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it\&#39;s driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky\&#39;s assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It\&#39;s a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker\&#39;s private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in &#34;Dead Man Walking&#34;, but Ziva starts having &#34;Tony issues&#34; that don\&#39;t slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette\&#39;s Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up &#34;Kaff-Pow!!&#34; was classic.  David McCallum\&#39;s Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira\&#39;s sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing &#34;head slaps&#34;.But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen\&#39;s personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs\&#39; attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano\&#39;s usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson\&#39;s Mike Franks--Gibbs\&#39; team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen\&#39;s Paula Cassidy in &#34;Grace Period&#34;, and that\&#39;s a shame.  But Armand Assante\&#39;s was insidious and slick as &#34;The Frog&#34;, and David Dayan Fisher\&#39;s turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it\&#39;s run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (&#34;Sorry, Caitlin&#34;) at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro\&#39;s life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny\&#39;s  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.&#39;,
         &#34;This, by the way, is the second review I&#39;ve written for this - don&#39;t know where the first one is.  Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can&#39;t wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin&#39; - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church&#39;s new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper&#39;s mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn&#39;t know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970&#39;s.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler&#39;s past if he doesn&#39;t make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn&#39;t happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin&#39; Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you&#39;re used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather&#39;s life, Sara discovers Gil&#39;s prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim. Will CSI stop her in time?Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer. It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end. Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship. At first the team aren&#39;t sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that&#39;s almost as exciting as working out who&#39;s behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7. It truly gets better always and I already can&#39;t wait for season 8.&#34;,
         &#34;The seventh season of the smash hit, original C.S.I. found the show still going strong, as opposed to when many network hits fizzle out by this time in their life.  The season opens with Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) keeping their relationship secret as a mystery unfolds regarding a killer who leaves behind exact, incredibly detailed, miniature replicas of the crime scene.  As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI&#39;s close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.  Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it&#39;s entire run, the original (and best) C.S.I. remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV, and the seventh season is a prime example why.&#34;,

         &#39;The first season of &#34;The Outer Limits&#34; was the best. Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them &#34;Solider&#34; and &#34;Demon with a Glass Hand&#34; which inspired James Cameron to come up with &#34;The Terminator&#34;. I\&#39;d give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven\&#39;t been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I\&#39;d average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don\&#39;t get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving &#34;The Man Who Was Never Born&#34; with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was &#34;The Outer Limits&#34; as its best. Also we get &#34;The Galaxy Being&#34; with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in &#34;The Sixth Finger&#34; about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.&#34;The Zanti Misfits&#34; like much of Stefano\&#39;s work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get &#34;The Borderlands&#34; and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like &#34;Human Factor&#34; but almost everything here is terrific even if we\&#39;re only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on &#34;The Outer Limits&#34;? Because MGM is convinced that you\&#39;ll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they\&#39;ve split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I\&#39;m at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you\&#39;re going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue. Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1&#39;,
         &#34;Michael C Hall, hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under, plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment. A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall&#39;s baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime&#39;s The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time. This , like House, is what great TV is all about!  I can not wait until October for season twoBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD&#34;,
         &#34;I just finished watching Dexter : Season 1 and it is phenomenal!I&#39;m an avid movie watcher and TV series watcher! Ive watched all the seasons of CSI Vegas and Law &amp; Order SUV, The Shield!Dexter is far superior to all of them. Season one starts out good, gets alot better half way through as the characters develop and ends with an amazing season finale!Showtime hit a homerun with this one! Im looking forward to Season 2 and have already lent my Season 1 set to a friend!&#34;,
         &#34;This is absolutely one of the most original series around. No surprise there because Dexter first appeared in  book form (see link below). If someone had told me I would be riveted by a book written from the viewpoint of a serial killer, well...I would never believe it. But Dexter was almost...loveable and he has a certain morality, believe it or not.The series is different but I found it equally intriguing and quirky.Here&#39;s the real irony in this series: someone who is so far from having normal human traits, who really doesn&#39;t understand love or sexual attraction, can reveal insights into what it means to be human in a way that a more stereotypical series doesn&#39;t. It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other. Dexter is dark but he isn&#39;t simplistic and he has a wry sense of humor.I was pleased that some of what had attracted me to the books managed to get on screen as well, including Dexter&#39;s unique humor and a certain presence that resonates from page to film. That pleased me. What is most amazing to me is how this series actually reverberated emotionally and touched my life in ways I never believed possible, considering the focus of the series.This could have been a flop. It was a brave move to put something like this on the air and I feared (before I saw the first episode) that the depth and complexity of Dexter, hiding beneath that slick, seemingly inhuman surface, would be lost. But my fears were groundless, thank goodnes.Dearly Devoted DexterDexter in the Dark: A NovelDarkly Dreaming Dexter&#34;,
         &#34;The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It&#39;s like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show.&#34;,
         &#34;Showtime&#39;s creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!&#34;,
         &#34;This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime&#39;s original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C. Hall (who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part).If you can handle the macabre, allow yourself to enter Dexter&#39;s world. You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over.&#34;,
         &#39;I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn\&#39;t nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a &#34;helpful&#34; way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that\&#39;s the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There\&#39;s no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don\&#39;t get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it\&#39;s super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly &amp; witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn\&#39;t exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he\&#39;s faking, we\&#39;re kinda in on the joke.  We can be &#34;amused&#34; along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true &#34;dark side&#34; to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn\&#39;t really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter\&#39;s killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it\&#39;s probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It\&#39;s a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar\&#39;s character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn\&#39;t perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you\&#39;ll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don\&#39;t even bother watching!&#39;,
         &#34;This isn&#39;t one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it&#39;s a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall&#39;s performance and voiceover work are very strong. He&#39;s stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.&#34;,
         &#39;If you\&#39;re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (&#34;Six Feet Under&#34;) plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his &#34;urges&#34; and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\&#39;s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\&#39;t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\&#39;s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama &#34;Brotherhood&#34;. We also get &#34;Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation&#34; a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to &#34;Dexter&#34; because that\&#39;s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\&#39;t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series &#34;The Tudors&#34; and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that &#34;The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course&#34; is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\&#39;t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\&#39;t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\&#39;s father a police officer recognized early on his son\&#39;s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his &#34;skills&#34; to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\&#39;s not normal and he also knows he doesn\&#39;t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something &#34;better&#34;.When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.&#39;,
         &#39;If you purchase this DVD, make sure you watch the extras on disc 4. Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who &#34;becomes&#34; Mackey as he pursues him, and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5\&#39;s eleven episodes. It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker\&#39;s contribution if it weren\&#39;t so spot-on perfect. On DVD 4, series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there &#34;was no second choice.&#34; If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called &#34;Raging Bulls,&#34; in which Dennis Franz\&#39;s Sipowicz and James McDaniel\&#39;s Lt. Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice &#34;Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?&#34; There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They\&#39;re two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close &#34;Capt. Rawling&#34; story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the &#34;extras&#34; portion of the set to &#34;Shakespearean&#34; drama), it\&#39;s clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target.&#39;,
         &#39;All roads for Vic Mackey (Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) lead to this. After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of &#34;The Shield&#34; karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of &#34;The Shield&#34; I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn\&#39;t be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey\&#39;s nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his &#34;moral&#34; character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&amp;A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season &#34;prequel&#34; that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you\&#39;ve caught the bug for &#34;The Shield&#34; but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended.&#39;,
         &#34;These guys don&#39;t pull any punches and that is why I love this show so much. This is another great season with up to the moment topics on real life! With all the pussyfooting around these days, this is a breath of fresh air....even after 10 seasons!&#34;,
         &#39;OK, there are a few episodes in this season that are a little much.  The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points.  Instead of being absurdly funny and clever, some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say, &#34;Look at me, look how shocking I am&#34; (&#34;The Return of Chef,&#34; &#34;Smug Alert!,&#34; &#34;A Million Little Fibers,&#34; &#34;Stanley\&#39;s Cup&#34;).  Still, this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television: &#34;Make Love Not Warcraft.&#34;  This episode is so well-done in animation (yes, excellent SP animation) and story-writing that I cannot praise it enough.  Plus, it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever: Paul Stanley!  Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future (Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious!) and  &#34;Cartoon Wars&#34; where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows. &#34;Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy&#34; takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can. The positives outweight the negatives here but it\&#39;s not perfect, so I can\&#39;t give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode. The cover of the box (Target edition) is awesome.  You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:&#34;The Return of Chef&#34;--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue. Hearing old Chef audio clips, the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club.  Yikes!&#34;Smug Alert!&#34;--People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they\&#39;re threatening the planet with emissions of another kind.  The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great.  I thought it was going to be another excellent episode.  At the point where the forest ranger explains what\&#39;s going on to Stan, things went downhill.  Here, the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement.  It is very contrived.&#34;Cartoon Wars Part 1&#34;--Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war.  While the nation buries its head in the sand (literally), Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him.&#34;Cartoon Wars Part 2&#34;--Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special...just kidding.  Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy.  I\&#39;ll admit that show makes a lot more sense now.  The Muslims\&#39; retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of &#34;The Passion of the Jew&#34; which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny.&#34;A Million Little Fibers&#34;--Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch...er...snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey.  This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2:&#34;Manbearpig&#34;--Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet.  Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig? Wait...isn\&#39;t manbearpig an endangered species?&#34;Tsst&#34;--Mrs. Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but, after failing on several nanny reality shows, has to resort to hiring a dog trainer.  One of the better episodes of this season.&#34;Make Love Not Warcraft&#34;--The best thing I\&#39;ve seen on TV, period.  Brilliant! It\&#39;s interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who isn\&#39;t a jerk to everyone...except Butters, of course.&#34;The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce&#34;--An unwelcomed sight in the boy\&#39;s room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy.  We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard.  The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal.&#34;Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy&#34;--A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student...a very young student.  Meanwhile, Cartman gets some real &#34;authoritie&#34; as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter.  His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3:&#34;Hell On Earth 2006&#34;--Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get.  Meanwhile, the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth.  A ho-hum episode. The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey doesn\&#39;t do it for me. It just doesn\&#39;t make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys.  Plus, Gacey would want to kill children, not adults and Dahmer would be killing young, dark-skinned men.&#34;Go God Go&#34;--Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class.  Meanwhile, Cartman can\&#39;t wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated.  Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard.&#34;Go God Go XII&#34;--Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and, therefore, no war...yeah right!  I like how they say &#34;science&#34; in their slurs instead of &#34;God&#34; or &#34;JC.&#34; When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious!  He finally gets to encounter his awful self but, of course, doesn\&#39;t learn anything from it.&#34;Stanley\&#39;s Cup&#34;--To get his bike out of impound, Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer.  This episode tries too hard to be heavy, but I guess that was the goal, er, point.&#39;,
         &#39;The landmark season of South Park saw Matt Stone and Trey Parker\&#39;s animated series back on top thanks to some scathing, satirical moments and just plain animated lunacy.  It also saw the departure of Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef, who departed after the previous season\&#39;s lampooning of scientology and Tom Cruise.  His departure is spoofed in the opening &#34;Return of Chef&#34; which uses archive sounds of Hayes\&#39; voice as Chef returns to South Park brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club, and seeling to &#34;re-connect&#34; with children.  Things only get better as Kyle\&#39;s dad buys a hybrid car in &#34;Smug Alert!&#34;, Al Gore seeks attention from anyone with &#34;Manbearpig&#34;, Cartman\&#39;s mom turns to the Dog Whisperer in &#34;Tsst!&#34;, Satan has a killer Halloween party in &#34;Hell on Earth 2006&#34;, and Cartman seeks to freeze himself in anticipation for the release of the Nintendo Wii in &#34;Go God Go&#34;.  The best moments of the season however came with the two part &#34;Cartoon Wars&#34; which hilariously lampooned Family Guy, and it makes sense in a way you\&#39;ve never imagined.  &#34;Make Love, Not Warcraft&#34; satires the players of the incredibly popular online RPG, and &#34;Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy&#34; finds little Ike having an illicit affair.  The only downpoint of the season is the closing &#34;Stanley\&#39;s Cup&#34; which finds Stan coaching a terrible pee-wee hockey team, for no apparent reason.  This episode just isn\&#39;t funny, at all.  Despite that though, every other episode here in the tenth season is a winner, and ten years and still going strong, South Park proves that these kids are quite alright.&#39;,
         &#39;Episodes like &#34;TSST&#34; (the Dog Whisperer episode) and &#34;The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce&#34; (featuring the Hardly Boys) are funnier the second and third time around.  The show is uneven, sure, but basically an American treasure.  The real prizes in this season are the 2-parters, the &#34;Family Guy&#34; 2-parter and the &#34;Go God Go&#34; 2-parter featuring Cartman in the 25th Century.  If you haven\&#39;t seen either of those, you\&#39;ve missed out on some of the best TV ever aired.&#39;,
         &#34;I was incredibly disappointed in season Six of 24. The reason I give this a three-star review as opposed to a two is that I think that perhaps the standards for this season to live up to were very dificult coming off of season Five, which is easily the best season of the show thus far. The plot seemed to go in far too many different directions, far too many relationships unresolved and there were far too many questions that remained unanswered. I applaud the show for being ambitious and trying different things, but there were too few moments of Jack doing what he does best and too many moments where the show felt like a long and very boring civics lesson in terms of presidential power and the transfer of it.Also the problem that seems to be facing this show right now is that Jack has little to no emotional investment anymore in CTU or in his own life. His best friends are all dead (and he&#39;s had to kill one of them himself), and his lover is practically catatonic. All he really seems to have left is the job (and his daughter), but that just doesn&#39;t seem like enough. The brains behind this great show had better find someone or something fast to get Jack to reinvest himself in emotionally or else this season could be the harbinger of doom for the Hour of Bauer&#39;s Power!!&#34;,
         &#39;Season 6 has varied reviews and a number of unhappy people, who claim that 24 is falling apart.  I feel killing almost everyone in season 5 resulted in much of the dissatisfaction with season 6.  The new people have no history and no claim to our affection.  If we are not watching someone we like and care about, we night think to much.  This is something the writers need to consider, the people are what makes the show and they need to be preserved.The story line is standard and not deep.  This is not a &#34;who done it&#34; or a deep thought provoking drama.  Plots and sub plots have been taken from past seasons and put together for a new story line.  During any hour, something occurs designed to make us want to watch the next hour.  As the clock ticks down 59:57, 59:58 something is happening that requires us to watch the next hour.  This is a cliffhanger and a darn good one!Jack, I agree with Secretary Heller.  You are cursed to provide us with high-energy entertainment that is great fun as long as we don\&#39;t think to much.  The series is much better on DVD, without commercials and waiting for next week.&#39;,
         &#34;In the time since Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was kidnapped, the United States has become a dangerous place.  Suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis, and no one is safe.  New President Wayne Palmer (D. B. Woodside) has arranged Jack&#39;s release from a Chinese prison camp.  Jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.Jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country.  But when he finds out that it was all a lie, he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists.  Only this time, they&#39;ve already struck once, leading to a calamity.  Meanwhile, the trail leads Jack to his own family.  What secrets are his dad and brother hiding?  Can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on America?And more importantly, what happened to this once great show?  I&#39;ve been a fan of this show since season one.  While my favorite season was the third, I&#39;ve thought all of the previous seasons were great.  But not this one.Part of the problem was the been there, done that factor.  The writers seem to be out of plot twists, so they are relying on the same one stand bys.  Unfortunately, loyal viewers can see those coming.  There was very little here that we hadn&#39;t seen before, which made the season boring.The other big problem was the dropped storylines.  Several times, a story was introduced and dropped in a matter of episodes.  Sometimes, they came back, sometimes they didn&#39;t, leaving us hanging.  Add to that the increase of personal drama over suspense, and you&#39;ve got a lack luster season.Now, it wasn&#39;t all bad.  This season was still entertaining.  But compared to the previous years, day six was a real let down.&#34;,
         &#39;When season 5 ended we left Jack on a freighter headed towards China.  When season 6 started Jack is being returned, complete with scars and a dazed expression, to be traded in a &#34;Bauer for Bombs&#34; exchange.  &#34;President Palmer the lesser&#34; bows out in the middle of the series to let the vice-president, who is diddling his turn coat assistant, run amock and make a lot of bad decisions that keeps the plot rolling along.  His chief of staff handles the dual role of good guy/bad guy (at the same time) well.  Back at CTU Mary Lynn must still have that bad smelling limburger cheese sandwich in her desk as her expression remains puckered again this year.  I\&#39;m not saying I didn\&#39;t have fun watching the current series - just that it may be getting a little chiche (but we still haven\&#39;t jumped the shark).&#39;,
         &#39;I give Season 4 of &#34;24&#34; four stars not rated relative to it\&#39;s own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, &#34;24&#34; is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it\&#39;s worse, &#34;24&#34; is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc..&#39;,
         &#39;Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)&#39;,
         &#39;From the tear-jerking premiere to the virtually perfect season finale, Season Two of &#34;Supernatural&#34; once again demonstrates how much better genre shows get in their second seasons.  Take a look at &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&#34; a show which, by the way, has a heavy influence on this wonderful series.  BtVS, like &#34;Supernatural,&#34; had humble beginnings, but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season.  &#34;Supernatural&#34; does the very same.Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here.  Dean and Sam\&#39;s relationship has become layered and, as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers, becomes the dramatic center of the show.  Replacing the &#34;monster of the week&#34; format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season.  Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season.  If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty, get this.  The mythology is expanded and strengthened.  The black and white, good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we\&#39;re all so interested in.  The comedy--again, very Buffy-esque--is amped up, including many laugh-out-loud moments.  The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale, which is--as I mentioned above--a moment of television perfection.  I haven\&#39;t been so euphoric about serialized television since the moment Joss Whedon\&#39;sAngel - Complete Series Collector\&#39;s Setcame to an end in 2004.Along withHeroes - Season OneandVeronica Mars - The Complete Third Season, the second chapter in Dean and Sam\&#39;s journey was among the best of the Fall 06-Spring 07 television season.9/10&#39;,
         &#34;Yes, the two leads are handsome and they may attract young female viewers.  But this is not some beefcake sitcom. This is Supernatural, a very dark and often gloomy story of two brothers who cannot live a normal life because they must carry on their father&#39;s legacy of demon-hunting.  This has dogged them since they were young and watched their own  mother die from a demon attack.What complicates matters is that the younger brother, Sam, has some psychic abilities which sometimes put him at risk.  Their father even told Dean that he might someday have to kill Sam to save him from himself and to protect others.  This leaves Dean with a sense of anxiety that never lets go.What I really like is that many episodes do not have some happy resolution; instead, the two brothers are left brooding on the life they are forced to live and the complications of their relationship and knowledge of each other.  No wife or kids for these guys; they are stuck on an endless road trip, running from harm or trying to destroy demons before they attack someone else.There are occasional lighthearted moments for comic relief--thank goodness.Think of this as a cross between Buffy and the X-Files. In fact, many XF writers and producers now work on this show, and it has the same foreboding atmosphere and music.&#34;,
         &#39;Special Features: &#34;The Devil\&#39;s Roadmap&#34;, &#34;Webisodes&#34;, three commentary tracks, gag reel, deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of &#34;Supernatural&#34;. The show benefited from top notch writing, direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show. The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended. Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) have located their dad  (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession. The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam\&#39;s mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him. Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature, find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its &#34;war&#34; against humanity. Then a truck hits Dean\&#39;s 1967 Impala. Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries. John makes a deal with the Devil or, in this case, the Demon they were pursuing--take his life for Dean\&#39;s. Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on &#34;In My Time of Dying&#34; (director Kim Manners and actors Ackles &amp; Padalecki), &#34;What Is And Should Never Be&#34; (writer Eric Kripe) and the first part of the season two finale &#34;All Hell Breaks Loose&#34; (Kripke, Manners and writer Sera Gamble) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes.&#34;The Devil\&#39;s Road Map&#34; is exactly that; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John\&#39;s book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters. We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as &#34;All Hell Breaks Loose&#34;. These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool.  We also get Jared Padalecki\&#39;s original screen test on videotape. The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown. It\&#39;s kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three &#34;webisode&#34; featurettes including &#34;The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor&#34; discussing the visual effects of the show, the overall look of these effects and how he approaches integrating the visuals into the show. &#34;Inside the Writer\&#39;s Room&#34; which also aired on the &#34;Supernatural&#34; website during season two features writer/creator/producer Kripke, writer/producer John Shiban and producer/writer/director Robert Singer where the trio point out that the show uses Urban folklore as the basis for most of their episodes. Sadly we can\&#39;t see the board with story ideas behind them. We also get glimpses of some of the storyboards including plenty of clips from the second season. &#34;The Inside Scoop with Chris Cooper&#34; is the final webisode included and features the prop master for &#34;Supernatural&#34; who discusses &#34;all the toys&#34; that the cast use on the show. Cooper discusses some of the fun stuff he gets to create including the guns and devices that Dean &amp; Sam use. The amusing gag reel rounds things out including a very funny scene where Padalecki has a practical joke played on him during shooting.&#34;Supernatural&#34; looks extremely good overall with nice color reproduction and detail. There are some digital artifacts and the images do blur a bit when there is rapid action on screen (which could be due to the fact that the show is shot and mastered in HD although it largely captures the &#34;look&#34; of film) but on the whole the show looks quite good.An exceptional second season with only a few dud episodes, I\&#39;d highly recommend the &#34;Supernatural&#34;. The show has hip humor that manages to capture much of the fun elements that made &#34;The X-Files&#34; so memorable (and hard to reproduce as the failed but interesting &#34;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&#34; from 2005 demonstrated). As with the previous the discs are housed in a fold out case with a brief synopsis and credits for each episode.&#39;,
         &#34;Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don&#39;t think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren&#39;t giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don&#39;t flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it&#39;s 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they&#39;re suffering aren&#39;t because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we&#39;re watching... and unfortunately, we&#39;re not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.&#34;,
         &#39;- Veronica (investigating Piz\&#39;s car, from which his moving-in stuff had been stolen): &#34;It doesn\&#39;t look like they jimmied their way in.&#34;- Piz: &#34;It wasn\&#39;t locked.&#34;- Veronica: &#34;College campus. All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?&#34;Nope, Neptune in Cali isn\&#39;t exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don\&#39;t change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she\&#39;s soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it\&#39;s the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn\&#39;t take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she\&#39;s always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn\&#39;t as good).But the show\&#39;s not all about Veronica (it\&#39;s just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she\&#39;s still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica\&#39;s clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace\&#39;s roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac\&#39;s roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there\&#39;s even a hasty wedding. As usual, it\&#39;s a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series\&#39;s abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn\&#39;t even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one\&#39;s a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would\&#39;ve been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica\&#39;s father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner &#34;Going Undercover with Rob Thomas&#34; (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: &#34;Main Titles: Why the Change?&#34;; &#34;Rob\&#39;s Directing Experience&#34;; &#34;Favorite Guest Star Moments&#34;; &#34;Veronica Mars: Mean Girl&#34; - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; &#34;The Politics of Veronica Mars&#34; - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his &#34;Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments&#34; and his &#34;Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments&#34;; &#34;Do-Overs?&#34; - scenes of which Thomas wasn\&#39;t too fond; and &#34;Highlights&#34; - more of Thomas\&#39;s fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas\&#39;s intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni\&#39;s many takes of &#34;I finally got the police report on the ****\&#39;s suicide&#34;). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q &amp; A-ing each other. There\&#39;s also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn\&#39;t gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season\&#39;s end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that\&#39;s when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: &#34;Debasement Tapes,&#34; in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; &#34;Postgame Mortem,&#34; in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There\&#39;s just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they\&#39;re in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show\&#39;s done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it\&#39;s still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: &#34;A long time ago, we used to be friends.&#34; VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, &#34;I find her nosiness charming.&#34;&#39;,
         &#34;This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it&#39;s 7th season. But hey at least that&#39;s way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn&#39;t coming back. Why can&#39;t the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren&#39;t canceled this year!&#34;,
         &#39;With high school now completely behind her, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) heads off to college.  In spite of her best efforts, she\&#39;s stuck in Neptune, attending Hearst College and living at home with her dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni).  As a result, it\&#39;s really no surprise when mystery and danger find her again.Veronica\&#39;s well earn reputation and the person who can solve the unsolvable gets her involved in one case after another.  Who is behind the &#34;Welcome Wagon&#34; and steals new student\&#39;s stuff?  Who would kidnap a monkey?  And where is the missing member of the board of trustees?Unlike previous seasons, there are two bigger mysteries.  The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus.  And the second one begins when college dean Cyrus O\&#39;Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is found dead in his office.And we can\&#39;t leave out her personal life.  Her on again off again relationship with Logan (Jason Dohring) creates problems, especially since friend Wallace\&#39;s (Percy Daggs III) new roommate Piz (Chris Lowell) is also interested in her.  With all this going on, will she ever have time to study?Unfortunately, this is the final season of a show I fell in love with right away.  The mysteries were sharp, requiring concentration to follow every week.  Yet the clues were there.  Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show.  The relationship soap opera, while at times annoying, never got too bad.  And all the acting was top notch.Having praised it, this is my least favorite season of the show.  And it\&#39;s not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes.  It was because the adult tone, definitely always present, became even more pronounced.  Of course, that\&#39;s what you\&#39;d expect with rape being a subject for half the season.  Even the details of Veronica\&#39;s personal life made me uncomfortable at times.As a result, I don\&#39;t recommend this show for young kids.  Older teens and adults will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir.&#39;,
         &#39;Season Three of &#34;Veronica Mars&#34; is often panned by critics and fans alike.  I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of &#34;Veronica Mars&#34; know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is classic V. Mars.Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually--I know this is true for a lot of people--the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that\&#39;s saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can\&#39;t go wrong.Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it\&#39;s story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.  It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled, as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.9/10&#39;,
         &#39;Warning!  Spoilers littered throughout this review!Note:  I\&#39;ll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn\&#39;t already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn\&#39;t find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, &#34;The opera ain\&#39;t over until the fat lady sings.&#34;  Well, she isn\&#39;t singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We\&#39;ll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We\&#39;ve seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn\&#39;t work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  &#34;Spit and Eggs,&#34; which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the &#34;how to win new fans&#34; issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn\&#39;t, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn\&#39;t seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin\&#39; BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network\&#39;s fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a &#34;just in case&#34; ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon\&#39;s when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don\&#39;t.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn\&#39;t get renewed.  It didn\&#39;t, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas\&#39;s reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show\&#39;s story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.  I\&#39;m delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years, but I\&#39;m still going to miss her mightily.&#39;,

         &#39;Sorry, but the other reviewers are leading you astray. As usual, (re)viewers fall in love with a show and think it can do no wrong. Well, plenty goes wrong in Earl\&#39;s second season---mainly the scripts.The writers are milking the same old laughs, and even a bunch of decent guest stars can\&#39;t make this nearly as funny as season one. They try to get outside the box at times, but when all of your characters are basically morons, things get a little stale after a while. The trailer park humor worked for a season, but now it\&#39;s just old.The only really funny thing on this show now is Joy; Pressly does a great job of making her lines come alive, show after show. Everyone else seems caught up by the slowly increasing weakness of the scripts. There\&#39;s also the feeling that now that the formula is set, let\&#39;s milk this puppy while we can. Randy and the cleaning lady are especially flat by the middle of this season.This season has its moments, but it also has loooong minutes of pedestrian writing and nothing interesting going on, and cheap attempts at weak laughs.Didn\&#39;t think this would jump the shark so soon.Earl\&#39;s list should now include, &#34;Had a good, really funny show and then made it boring.&#34;&#39;,
         &#39;Season 1 was simply fantastic. This is slightly a let-down. Probably because the novelty has worn off slightly. As we know Earl is a no-good guy who discovers Karma and decides to undo some wrong things he has done in the past. The persona of Earl is still very sweet and maybe one positive thing is that the episodes are somewhat less aggressive in tone than sometimes in the first season but it is nevertheless not as great.&#39;,
         &#34;The Riches is one of the most original series ever with characters who are complex and intriguing. Each episode holds you captive as Wayne (Eddie Izzard) and Dahlia Malloy (Minnie Driver) strive to impersonate the Rich family, an immense challenge with their lack of education and experience.This is a series where you never know what is going to happen next or how Wayne is going keep it all together but the love that Wayne and Dahlia have for each other and their children always help them to find a way.Izzard and Driver are simply eloquent. Noel Fisher (Cael), Shannon Marie Woodwood (DiDi) and Aidan Mitchel (Sam) are genuine in their roles as the three Malloy children.I can&#39;t wait for this to come out on dvd!&#34;,
         &#34;This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can&#39;t give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff.&#34;,
         &#39;Moments of real comedy on this show, and sometimes really brave comedy, are almost always followed by moments of truly moronic humor. &#34;Poop&#34; jokes are a favorite, for example. Sarah gets points for the occasionally brilliant surrealistic humor, then loses them for her sheer idiocy. It\&#39;s hard to like this person/character, despite her occasional genius.She is also very anti-semitic at times. But, she is also Jewish. Are Jews allowed to make nasty fun of Jews and also of manufactured anti-semitic hysteria? Anyone else would be declared a war criminal for making a joke about big noses...but apparently if you\&#39;re Jewish you can go much, much much farther than that. At one point she even suggests the Holocaust was faked. How dare she? To the electric chair! But wait...she\&#39;s Jewish...I would love to see more Christian and Buddhist and Hindu and Muslim and Jainist etc comedians who have this sort of egotistical self-loathing cushioned by loathing of everything and everyone else as well. But somehow we don\&#39;t get much of that.Silverman says that\&#39;s because the media is largely owned and run by and for the Zionists who make the US fight their wars while they run their banks and Federal Reserve, but she is Jewish, so she can say that. It\&#39;s darn offensive, however true it may or may not be, and I think she should apologize. It does explain her getting to do a show this offensive, though, so maybe it all makes sense. Her boyfriend is Jimmy Kimmel, perhaps the least talented person on TV (quite a feat), so it all fits together in some arcane fashion.In any case, while there\&#39;s some uniquely weird and funny stuff here, the poop that surrounds it makes it somewhat of a moot point.It ain\&#39;t normal, so that\&#39;s a plus.But it\&#39;s also often so mean-spirited that it just ain\&#39;t funny.&#39;,
         &#39;Liking this show depends on how much you like Sarah. I think she is a funny gal, so I like the show. The show is full of potty humor and she does have a very good &#34;off the wall&#34; supporting cast. Since there are only 6 episodes included in season 1, I won\&#39;t be buying this set unless it drops down in price a little. I can\&#39;t wait to see season two!&#39;,
         &#34;It is impossible to watch this show without some kind of strong reaction.  There were times watching this show that I laughed as hard as I have laughed at anything I&#39;ve seen in recent years.  But there were also times when I was simply appalled at how unfunny and in bad taste some parts were, as if the point had ceased being to make us laugh and had become to shock and dismay us.  There are many moments when I am simply blown away by the brilliance and originality of Silverman&#39;s comic vision and times when I wonder if she has any conception of what is funny and what is not.This is definitely not a show for everyone and it has nothing to do with how well one&#39;s sense of humor is developed.  There are simply a lot of absolutely terrible moments in these episodes to go along with some hysterically funny ones.  If you can filter out or ignore the bad and merely focus on the good, this is a show you will either partially enjoy or consider a masterpiece.  But if you can&#39;t filter out the bad or if you obsess over the bad to a degree where you can&#39;t appreciate the genuinely funny bits, then you could well consider this to be one of worst shows ever concocted.I especially loved the initial episode, where Sarah buys some cough syrup that has a decided effect on her perception of reality.  That episode -- and especially Sarah&#39;s self-absorption that is so extreme that she almost obtains a childlike innocence -- reminds me very much of the balance that Paul Reubens was able to strike in PEE WEE&#39;S PLAYHOUSE.  Unfortunately, she is not able to maintain that balance through the rest of the series.  I did not enjoy any subsequent episode as much as that one, though the one in which she thought she was dying of AIDS came close.  Here is a bit that presents the show at its best.  Sarah is feeling a bit down so she decides to go get an AIDS test so that she&#39;ll feel better when it comes up negative.  As part of the exam she is asked to respond to a questionnaire that tracks her lifestyle choices.  Here is a bit of that dialogue:Nurs:  Did you ever have a blood transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: Yeah.Nurse: (alarmed) You did? You had a transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: (bemused) Oh! Ha!  No--I thought you said in Haiti.Nurse: (even more alarmed) How long were you in Haiti?Sarah: Oh that&#39;s hard to say; I was doing a lot of heroin at the time.On the other hand, there are the truly awful moments, most of which cannot be repeated on a board like this.  It wasn&#39;t merely that they were off color or excessive or extreme.  They were simply not funny.  And being extreme simply for the sake of being extreme is not funny.  Andy Kaufman could pull that off, but few others.So, this is a show that can only receive a limited recommendation.  More perhaps than any other comedian today, Sarah Silverman invites extreme reactions.  There have been many moments where I have found her to be as funny as anyone alive and times when I can&#39;t tolerate her.  I suspect that this is pretty much what you will always get with her.  But I will say this:  there isn&#39;t anyone else out there quite like her.&#34;,
         &#39;I just finished watching the entire first season of &#34;The Tudors.&#34; When the show first premiered on Showtime, I watched the pilot episode and never bothered to watch it again. I thought the show was visually appealing, but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste. However, I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII, and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation. I watched all the episodes of &#34;The Tudors&#34; On Demand in less than a week, and I really enjoyed them.In order to appreciate this program, you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is. Yes, the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events, but this is a cable television series, and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience. As a result, all of the people in King Henry\&#39;s court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life, and there are some major alterations to historical timelines. Still, I\&#39;m impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show, and overall, it\&#39;s very engaging to watch. The pacing is exciting and fast...perhaps a little too fast, in my opinion. For example, Elizabeth &#34;Bessie&#34; Blount gets knocked up with Henry\&#39;s illegitimate child in the very first episode, and by the second episode, she\&#39;s already giving birth. I wonder how long &#34;The Tudors&#34; can realistically continue to air with such a rushed chain of events.For the most part, I think the casting of the show is excellent. I\&#39;ve never been a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers until now, but his portrayal of Henry VIII is intense, dramatic, and exciting. Sam Neill is brilliant as the two-faced Cardinal Wolsey, and Natalie Dormer is perfect as the bewitching Anne Boleyn. As far as the characterizations of these famous characters goes, I think Henry VIII has been a bit one-sided in Season 1. I\&#39;ll be interested to see how Meyers tackles the role when Henry finds himself betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for. It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry. Also, I think Anne has actually been pretty likable so far...hopefully she\&#39;ll become a much darker character in Season 2.Overall, I enjoyed &#34;The Tudors&#34; much more than I thought I would. It\&#39;s entertaining, and people who enjoy learning about this period in history will definitely get a kick out of it. I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of Season 2.&#39;,
         &#34;Firstly, I have never seen the show.  I love science fiction but usually only in the movies because I find a lot of the sci-fi shows on tv to be low budget with poor scripting and acting.This show however looks fantastic, if you didn&#39;t tell me it was a tv series I&#39;d think it was a movie.  Aside from looking great the story looks to be engaging, exciting and just plain entertaining.  The whole point of this download is to get you into the show and to get you updated on what has happened so far, it does that well, I feel like I could just jump in and start watching the show.**A warning though, if you plan on buying/watching all of the old Battlestar Galactica episodes in the prior seasons I&#39;d hold of on watching this as it will spoil it for you.**I recommend taking a look.  And while your at it take a look at the other free download, it&#39;s good too.  Here:SCI FI: Inside Battlestar Galactica&#34;,
         &#39;One of the biggest treats of the 2007 television season was &#34;Damages,&#34; a wicked and wonderful legal thriller from FX.  Headlined by Glenn Close, I expected to enjoy this show--but I wasn\&#39;t prepared for the level of sophistication, complexity, and intelligence it offered up from its first twisty, and twisted, moments.  Made for adults, this drama demands attention and may not be for the casual viewer.  With its intricate plotting and structure, the story is told from different time periods interwoven throughout each episode.  Essentially, snippets of the story are presented in each time frame, so the audience is left to speculate about the full truth in any given instance.  However, as the season progresses, the pieces start to connect in unexpected ways that can both surprise and frustrate.  I\&#39;d compare the narrative flow of &#34;Damages&#34; to that of a fine novel--telling you just enough so that you are tantalized to stick around for the next chapter.The plot of &#34;Damages&#34; is a knotty web that is difficult to describe briefly.  Ostensibly, the show revolves around a naive young lawyer played by Rose Byrne.  The opening scenes show a bedraggled and bloodied Byrne stumbling down the streets of New York--apparently the victim (or perhaps the perpetrator) of an act of violence.  Cut to six months earlier and a proper introduction is made.  Byrne is seduced and recruited by a major law firm run by Glenn Close.  Close seems to have a hidden agenda, but Byrne is quickly overcome by the trappings of success and acceptance.  The firm is handling an enormous class action lawsuit against one of the town\&#39;s most prominent businessmen, played by Ted Danson, and Byrne ends up squarely in the midst of much legal intrigue.  What follows includes lying, blackmail, corruption, and even murder--no one in this story remains an innocent.While I actually think the plot is the real star of &#34;Damages&#34; (I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever said that about a TV show before)--it certainly doesn\&#39;t hurt that the cast is uniformly excellent.  Don\&#39;t be surprised if you see Close front and center come awards time.  Her thinly veiled menace and cutting remarks make for classic villainy, but Close pulls it off in a way that you can\&#39;t help but love!  Byrne and all the key supporting players are solid and believable.  I particularly liked Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Facinelli, but the real revelation to me was Ted Danson.  Honestly, I\&#39;ve followed Danson since he was a bit player in &#34;Body Heat&#34; and I think this is by far his best role.  Mixing equal parts charm and bile, this is a great actor in a beautifully written role.Again, I don\&#39;t recommend &#34;Damages&#34; to everyone--I only wish I could!  If, however, you love sophisticated drama--give this a shot.  The DVD format is the perfect way to watch this show at your own pace and enjoy all its subtleties, surprises, and delights.  But, be reminded, if you sit down to watch this show--WATCH IT!  Otherwise, you might not appreciate how intricately put together &#34;Damages&#34; really is.  KGHarris, 12/07.&#39;,
         &#39;Life is my favorite show of the season.It is well acted, well written, with a fascinating and original premise.The show is full of philosophy, i.e. mans search for meaning and justice.Add to that a couple of beautiful actresses thrown into the mix, and &#34;Life&#34; is a thinking man\&#39;s perfect show!03/01/08I just rewatched all the pre stike episodes this week...And again, I think this is the best drama of the year and one of the best ever on TV. If you haven\&#39;t seen this show yet, do yourself a favor and start at the beggining and get addicted like me.&#39;,
         &#39;interesting from the start. i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show, but this one was so good i cannot wait for the next episode. bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv. this show could easily have been on hbo. i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one. judging from the rest of the slate available so far, this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid. indeed its grand, nuanced and wonderful. and as i said, very very smert.&#39;,
         &#34;Despite the Monk-like, strange habits exhibited by the Cop-turned-Prisoner-turned-Detective, Charlie, the story provided an excellent synopsis for a cop trying to recapture what he had and then some, while secretly solving his past.  I&#39;ll give a few more episodes before making any solid commentments, but LIFE is so far, so good.&#34;,
         &#34;Based on the promos, this show didn&#39;t appeal to me at all.  But I downloaded the free pilot figuring I could always just delete it if it wasn&#39;t my cup of tea.  But I found that I liked the main character and although the premise is unlikely, so are most TV shows, if you think about it.Its really more of a drama that has humor, rather than a comedy with drama (if that makes any sense).I will watch this one.&#34;,
         &#34;The show is great.  It&#39;s geeky but not too geeky, it&#39;s funny but serious and action packed too.  I like the casting, Chuck is great.This episode sets up the premise for the entire series well and I can&#39;t wait to see what the rest of the season holds.  I&#39;ll be setting up a season pass for this one!&#34;,
         &#34;Warning!  Spoilers!CHUCK VERSUS THE NEMESIS is the latest in a string of very nice episodes.  I&#39;ve not been charmed by everything in this series.  There are fans of the show who love Morgan and those who utterly detest him.  I&#39;m of the latter camp.  And early in the season I almost gave up on the show due to the series initial emphasis on standalone episodes couples with more Morgan than I could tolerate.  But there has been slightly less Morgan (a little of him goes a very, very, very long way) and far more in the way of a serial structure to the show.  As a result, my interest has gone up sharply.This episode picks up from the previous one, in which Sarah kissed Chuck, only to discover that her former lover/CIA partner Bryce was still alive.  Obviously, this complicates everything.  I&#39;ll keep the spoilers light except to add that the episode ends with Sarah being forced to choose between staying on her assignment with Chuck or going off with Bryce.  Given that she has a longterm contract on the show, there isn&#39;t a great deal of tension.  The question obviously isn&#39;t whether Sarah will end up staying, but under what conditions.I&#39;m coming to like this show more and more as the ongoing story continues.  I&#39;m really delighted that it has not persisted in offering nothing but standalone episodes.  I&#39;ve mentioned in many reviews that the one massive advantage TV has over the movies is the serial format.  A TV series can develop a narrative and provide character development that no movie ever made can even remotely hope to match.  Shows that turn their backs on that natural superiority of TV to movies do not receive my respect.&#34;,
         &#34;I felt that the new show &amp;#34;Life&amp;#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese&#39;s (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese&#39;s addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that&#39;s ok. But, the writer&#39;s attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me.&#34;,
         &#34;For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it&#39;s first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode.&#34;,
         &#34;Life is one of the freshest new shows on TV right now. I love the main character, I love Adam Arkin&#39;s character, I just cannot recommend this series highly enough.The zen take on everything really makes this an offbeat yet engaging cop series.&#34;,
         &#34;In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie&#39;s reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They&#39;ve got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot.&#34;,
         &#39;As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don\&#39;t undertand why they didn\&#39;t just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn\&#39;t deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn\&#39;t tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say &#34;Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing. And the first thing should be for Michelle Ryan to start showing some emotion and act better.&#39;,
         &#34;The show was great.  It was entertaining and action packed throughout.I&#39;ll have to watch a few more before I really decide how much I like it.  Part of that will depend on the main character, I&#39;m not sure about the casting for her yet, something feels off but maybe she will grow on me.&#34;,
         &#34;This episode shows the kind of potential that THE BIONIC WOMAN has and is easily the best so far.  The widely reported rumor is that there has been disarray on the set of the show.  The good news is that NBC seems to be a big believer in the show and has taken every possible effort to make it a success.  The other bit of good news is that the show is already quite good, even if in disarray.  Now, it is also perfectly possible that things were confused on the set, but that many of the difficulties were solved by excellent editing.  But if one didn&#39;t know from other sources that the production is supposed to be a bit of a mess, you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell by the finished episode.  After a few episodes show runner Glen Morgan left the show.  Jason Katims, who is the executive producer of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, has been taken on as a consulting producer.  I&#39;ve read also that a number of FNL writers have gotten involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN.  NBC clearly thinks this show could be a hit for several years.Clearly, NBC&#39;s reaction to THE BIONIC WOMAN shows the beginning of a trend in responding to productions that have some onset confusion.  The prototype was last year&#39;s BROTHERS AND SISTERS, which by all accounts was simply a god awful mess.  The initial show runner quit over creative differences (she is now the show runner, ironically, for the show that runs opposite THE BIONIC WOMAN, ABC&#39;s PRIVATE PRACTICE) and NBC was forced to put together a new production team.  The result was a completely rejuvenated program, one that by the end of the year was enjoying both respect by critics and dedication by fans (of which, I must confess, I am not one).All of which excites me.  If THE BIONIC WOMAN is this good while the production team was not a smooth running machine, what will it be like once it is tuned up?This episode lays out what will clearly be a major story arc on the show, the strained but unbreakable connection between Jaime Sommers and Sarah Corvus.  Some people have complained about Michelle Ryan&#39;s performance as Jaime, but I think she has been fine and that she will get even better as her character is allowed to develop more confidence.  I think the problem is not Michelle Ryan, but that Katee Sackhoff&#39;s performance as Sarah Corvus is just so spectacularly good that she makes everyone around her look bad in comparison.  Sarah Corvus dominates every scene she is in, much the way that on BUFFY Faith and Spike tended to take over when they put in an appearance.My one concern with the series at this point is how good it is going to be when we get less Sarah Corvus.  THE BIONIC WOMAN started filming before BATTLESTAR GALACTICA did, so that Katee Sackhoff, who plays Starbuck on the latter, was available for early episodes.  At some point we will inevitably see less Sarah.  My understanding is that Sackhoff&#39;s boss, David Eick, is working with her to keep her involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN as much as possible while BSG wraps up and having both shows film in Vancouver certainly helps.  Still, at least for a while Sarah will have to play a diminished role.  But one thing seems certain:  no performer on television will play such a crucial role on two series this year as Katee Sackhoff.All in all, I think this episode was a big improvement over the second one.  I liked the pilot, but the second episode was a tad flat.  Hopefully this episode is a sign of things to come.&#34;,
         &#34;A new show with great potential, but I&#39;ll need to see more clarity in the future stories since this one gave bits &amp; pieces of many things to come.  As long as some of the mysteries and/or underlying stories start to come together in an overall idea, then I&#39;ll be watching.  Otherwise, just another remake that didn&#39;t quite make it.  We&#39;ll hope for the best.&#34;,
         &#39;I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved. The new show has brought in more technology than the original series, while keeping the theme similar. This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both &#34;sisters&#34; are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC.&#39;,
         &#39;This show I really enjoyed (except the &#34;evil american agencies&#34; bit is wearing very thin to me) a funny show without a laugh track is always a plus to me. I don\&#39;t know if they will find enough material to write to keep me engaged, but the pilot was pretty entertaing, (the action sequence in the biggining was pretty exciting, and the rest pretty funny.I hope they can keep it up.Update November 27, 2007This show has pleasingly gotten better each week. The Characters are more developed and sympathetic.  And while this may not go down in TV history as one of the greatest shows of all time, it continues to be a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an hour.&#39;,
         &#34;This is a great new show. The show has excellent oddball humor and great lines. The characters are hilarious and they have made great scene sequences (e.g. Casey getting the cutomer service tutorial) and Chuck just draws you in into his predicament. I especially enjoy when he talks to Sarah about their fake relatiosnhip, if that relationship were in fact real, they would go on a date. Chuck is just a great show, a must watch. The show has refenreces to video games that are fun to figure out. The cast is very amusing and entertaining. The only people that seem out of place are Chuck&#39;s sister and her boyfriend or husband, Captain Awesome.UPDATE 11/19/2007:This show is still great. I can&#39;t wait for Monday nights to watch this show. The relationships between Chuck and Sarah is so exciting. Every episode, every new development and every character adds even more excitement and fun to this show. And Rachel Bilson&#39;s character is great. This show has everything going for it: great and funny dialogue, great performances, amazing chemistry among the characters and great and unbelievable storylines.&#34;,
         &#34;I was looking forward to this show... I&#39;ve always enjoyed the shows about time travel.  But I still don&#39;t understand what causes him to go back in time.... if it was explained I missed it.There were some clues that I guess were too subtle for me to catch as they happened, and I only &#39;got it&#39; at the end of the show... Is that what they were going for?  Anyway.. I will probably watch one more episode, and then if it isn&#39;t any better I&#39;ll pass....&#34;,
         &#34;K. Watlet (another reviewer) is crazy!  This was an excellent story!  I really don&#39;t see how it will remain interesting as a series but it would have made an excellent miniseries or movie.  The acting was real, the camera angles were good, the shifting back and forth through time was done very well and there were times I didn&#39;t know which time he was in.  The only reason I watched it is because it was free and I am so glad that I did!&#34;,
         &#39;From what I can tell, Journeyman has gone the way of a lot of promising shows before it with low ratings. It\&#39;s too bad as this show was starting to hit its stride, and had shaken my initial perception as a Quantum Leap ripoff. To the credit of the producers, the final filmed episode, &#34;Perfidia,&#34; offers a neat enough closure to the series that fans won\&#39;t feel cheated. Hopefully, the Sci Fi channel or some other cable outlet will pick up the show--it deserves another chance.&#39;,
         &#39;Journeyman looks to be another series with promise. I watched the Unbox download of the Pilot episode, and... If you don\&#39;t just hate the idea of a show with time traveling involved, this should be a good series for thinking people.The premise seems to be somewhere in a mix of &#34;Quantum Leap&#34; (at least the part of fixing what is screwed up with the timeline) but more &#34;The Time Traveler\&#39;s Wife, and Ken Grimwood\&#39;s &#34;Replay&#34;.Mid ~Season Update November 27, 2007Journeyman is meeting all my expectations for the shows development. I remain hooked!The make or break for this show will be do the real world characters generate enough empathy to hook you on the show, and will the &#34;fix it&#34; parts of the plot be interesting.I think there is a good chance they can make this work. I hope I am right.&#39;,
         &#39;Althought it started out slow, the story picked up enough to capture my attention and hold it through to the end.  I like how he was able to prove his story to at least one person important in his life to give him the chance for a &#34;home&#34; that doesn\&#39;t turn out to be an insane asylum.  The character development was basic, but adequate enough to show hints of other, less obvious relationships that I\&#39;m sure will  be cleared up,inlater episodes.  Overall a very good possibility for my interests, so I\&#39;ll be watching.&#39;,
         &#34;The show started off as intriguing and has developed into a very solid drama. It has potential to really excel and become one of the best new dramas, but needs more time to develop. Unfortunately, the writers&#39; strike may have a negative effect on the show&#39;s future. I am truly impressed with the fairly accurate representation of the Bay Area both historical and present day. There are always a few minor things that get fudged, but, for the most part, it is true to this region. Give it a chance and have fun.&#34;,
         &#39;When I was watching the pilot episode I wasnt sure if I was going to like the show. Then everything fell together at the end of the pilot and I have been hook on the show ever since.  The acting is great and the time jumping gives you the blast from the past feeling.&#39;,
         &#39;This show first developed the backgrounds of the characters really well and added the sci-fi elements as a spice to the series. The creaters of the show have selected &#34;family members&#34; of the main characters &#34;Dan &amp; Katie&#34; who manage to be very similar in features to the two main characters. I think the show has done a superb job of recreating the past of San Francisco and the cultural elements of the years that the main character, Dan, travels too. The stories flow together creating a nice arc of the family interactions and current cultural dynamics mixed with good sci-fi based on quantium theory that the viewer can actually believe. There is a balance between the good that Dan does and the sinister aspect of being watched by the government in recent story lines. While each show can be a stand alone episode, I enjoy watching this show and learning  more about the characters\&#39; challenges with the concepts of Sci-fi that influence the show each week. It\&#39;s also nice to see a family demonstrating love and support of each other for a change.&#39;,
         &#39;I really enjoyed this show.  It gets 5 stars from me because I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud.  This show has definite potential!  I will definitely watch this one.&#39;,
         &#39;this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired.&#39;,
         &#39;Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with &#34;unfunny&#34;.It\&#39;s geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on.&#39;,
         &#39;First, my four-star rating is a tad generous.  I rounded it up from the three and a half that it deserves.A host of fans and ex-fans and critics have thoroughly thrashed HEROES so far this season.  I doubt if this episode and the incredibly disappointing use of Kristen Bell will turn things around.  The reason the show has gone south is easy to locate:  the writing is simply below par.  This comes out in a host of ways.  Let me enumerate just a few.First, after a fun Season One in which we were all waiting for the various heroes to come together, they were all immediately dispersed in the first episode of Season Two.  Structurally, everything that happened in Season One screamed for some unification of the characters.  But nothing like this occurred.  Instead, the series feels like it has been restarted.  Not good.Second, instead of focusing on the already large cast of characters, they decided to introduce a large number of new characters.  I think the fury of many fans against the Central American sister and brother making their way north is more than anything anger that time is being spent on characters other than those already established.  And while I really like Dana Davis and think she is the cutest thing this side of sliced toast, her power seems too similar to Peter\&#39;s.  Anything she sees others do, she can do as well.  Anyone with a power, Peter can acquire by being in close proximity.Third, the stories simply aren\&#39;t very interesting so far.  It is possible that the foundation for an interesting story later on is being laid, but not much so far has actually been very compelling.The introduction of Kristen Bell is a prime example of what has gone wrong with the show.  I\&#39;ve avoided spoilers so I wasn\&#39;t sure what her power was going to be (though had I seen the teaser that Amazon\&#39;s Unbox uses to introduce it I might have).  They reveal her power almost immediately and in such a mundane way!  Wasted opportunity guys!  It should have been teased out a bit.  And after she finds out where Peter Petrelli is she is called away from Ireland to another part of the world.  Why?  The only interesting thing about her debut was the revelation that she works for her father.  But here again I\&#39;m afraid that HEROES is going to disappoint.  Usually when we get info like that in a well written show we imagine that we don\&#39;t know who the father is, only to learn later that we do.  My fear is that we haven\&#39;t met her father but that he will be an entirely new character.I enjoyed HEROES in Season One, but I always thought it was somewhat overrated by many fans.  I was astonished that anyone considered this better than LOST, let alone vastly superior shows like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  And PUSHING DAISIES can be added to that list.  But this year so far at least 15 or 20 shows have been better.  I gave Season One a five-star review and I do feel that it deserved it.  But overall so far I would give Season Two a three.  But I tend to be an optimist.  I both hope and believe it will get better.One last word.  I wonder what the departure of Bryan Fuller as Consulting Producer has meant for the show.  He wrote what was far and away the best episode of HEROES so far, the absolutely splendid (and Emmy nominated) &#34;Company Man.&#34;  I don\&#39;t know how much he brought to the show.  But I do know this:  so far HEROES has been a disappointment, while Bryan Fuller\&#39;s new show PUSHING DAISIES has debuted with three absolutely astonishing episodes.  I hope the title of Fuller\&#39;s new show doesn\&#39;t eventually apply to his old one.&#39;,
         &#34;Although through the first few episodes FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS remained one of the most compelling shows on TV, it had suffered a bit from some structural problems in its narrative.  On the one hand, Coach Taylor was off at Texas Methodist University, making his ongoing involvement in the narrative a challenge.  On the other hand, there was the unnecessarily melodramatic killing by Landry of Tyra Collette&#39;s Season One stalker/attempted rapist.  The latter has been a problem because what made Season One so outstanding was how it felt like an encapsulation of real lives.  The killing simply didn&#39;t feel real.In my opinion the show always managed to overcome these missteps to remain a fascinating and engrossing show.  But it did generate the sense that the season in some ways hadn&#39;t really begun.  In this episode, however, Coach Taylor is back in Dillon, back in his old job, and returned to his family.  And his return already seems to have helped several individuals.  His wife Tami already seems less stressed.  His daughter, who had been sorely tempted by the older bad boy known as The Swede, seems to have recovered her relationship with her mother, who gave her advice that may have helped Julie realize just how lame The Swede truly was.  And he seems to have helped Buddy Garrity just as much.  In the first three episodes Buddy seemed unsure of himself, rattled by the loss of his family as well as his status within the booster club.  Here he is as confident as ever.The delicious part about this episode, as with the series as a whole, was the sheer number of things that took place in it.  The show in many ways breaks with much traditional TV writing.  A typical episode will have an A plot and a B plot, though after HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties, many shows would have multiple threads in an episode.  But some episodes of FNL have 7 or 8 or 9 threads going at once.  Yet, it doesn&#39;t come across as at all incoherent or muddled.  I&#39;d love to see how they organize their various arcs.  I assume they have some sort of ongoing storyboard.After being a major part of the first three episodes, the Tyra-Landry romance/murder ordeal played a somewhat smaller role in terms of time.  Tyra does come to Landry&#39;s house for dinner, a nice touch.  Though she has been increasingly attached to Landry, she has been somewhat unwilling to make their relationship obvious in public, let alone to her or his family.  So this represents a big step, especially combined with her explanation in the previous episode to Landry&#39;s father why she likes Landry (a great scene because it was almost as if verbalizing to someone THAT and WHY she liked Landry caused her to realize just how much she had come to feel for him).  While at dinner, however, Landry and Tyra overhear what they had been anticipating:  the discovery of her assailant&#39;s body.  I have no inside knowledge of what is going to happen on the show, but I think it is pretty clear that Landry is going to confess to what he did.So, despite a couple of things that seems atypical for this remarkable show, FNL seems entirely back on track.  These remain a collection of many of the best characters on television and the acting in this show can stand comparison with any other show.  I&#39;m still not too excited about it being scheduled on Friday, but it remains, along with PUSHING DAISIES (easily the best new show of the season) the one show I most look forward to each week.&#34;,
         &#34;Warning!  There are some spoilers in this review.In the spring of 2007 it was reported that NBC had asked the producers of THE OFFICE to expand it permanently to a one-hour format.  Initially I thought this was a terrible idea, that the show would be irreparably weakened by expanding it to an hour.  Then I saw the Season Three DVDs with the deleted scenes and with so many really great deleted scenes, I though that perhaps it would be possible to expand it to an hour.  Now, however, I&#39;m not so sure.  Especially after this last of the four one-hour episodes that start off Season Four.  As a half hour show, THE OFFICE almost always leaves you wanting more.  But as a one-hour show, it always seems to go on too long.  Like most of the four episodes starting off this season, this one just felt like it was over before it was over.I&#39;m not saying that it would never be a good idea to have an hour-long episode.  The show has had some very good expanded episodes in the past.  But four in a row seems to have stretched the show further than it really wanted to go.  I&#39;m actually looking forward to it going back to shorter episodes next week.This episode revolves largely around two major stories.  First, Michael&#39;s increasing money woes created by having Jan live with him without working any herself.  To help make a bit more money he takes a second fulltime job as a telemarketer.  The scenes showing him at his second job are the weakest in the episode and really do feel like padding to make the show go a full hour.  The other major story centers around Pam and Jim deciding to visit Dwight&#39;s bed and breakfast.  After three years of teaming together to play tricks on Dwight -- and indeed this visit starts off as a trick on Dwight -- they realize how deeply he is hurting because of his break up with Angela (caused by his killing her elderly but deeply beloved cat by putting him in her freezer) and make a couple of gestures to try and make him feel better.  For instance, they give his utterly dreadful B&amp;B; a stellar review on the Internet.  I like the symmetry of Pam and Jim not being together for a long period of time during much of which Dwight and Angela had a hidden relationship.  And now that Jim and Pam are together, Angela and Dwight have broken up.I have no doubt that the show will get back on track, but to do so, the network needs to permanently commit to the show being only a half hour each week.&#34;,
         &#39;Minor spoilers!After a rough off-season for Alec Baldwin -- complete with rumors that he wanted to leave 30 ROCK and a parenting controversy that kept him in the tabloids for a spell -- and a surprisingly disappointing season premiere, both Baldwin and the show can be said to be completely back on track.  As the Amazon description reports, the A plot focuses on Jack\&#39;s effort to outposition Devon Banks (marvelously portrayed by Will Arnett in a reprise of his Season One guest appearance) to become Don Geiss\&#39;s replacement at GE, the parent company to NBC Universal.  The struggle is quite funny.  Devon, who is a lightly closeted gay, has &#34;turned straight&#34; and is courting Geiss\&#39;s daughter.  He is also using the fact of Jack\&#39;s heart attack, which he has attempted to keep quiet, to lessen his position within the corporation.  In response, Jack merely recruits a young, very handsome dude who tempts Devon beyond his powers to resist.  All in all, it is gamesmanship on a very funny level.The B plot is quite as good.  Jenna is still very overweight from all her pizza consumption during her involvement in a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA during the summer break.  The writers attempt to take advantage of her weight gain by having her character shout &#34;Me want food!&#34; onstage, which Jenna adamantly refuses to do.  But when a skit falls apart onstage, she panicks and ad libs the line she said she wouldn\&#39;t say.  Surprisingly, she is delighted when the line becomes a national catch phrase.  Suddenly, the extra weight gain, previously a liability, is now her good fortune.  Unfortunately, she now has to keep her weight up.The first episode of the season had been a serious disappointment, mainly because they stopped doing what they do well in order to restructure the episode around Jerry Seinfeld.  But this episode shows the series completely back on track.  It ramains one of the two or three funniest shows on TV.&#39;,
         &#39;First off, I\&#39;ve enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they\&#39;ve all had some things in common, and they\&#39;ve all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who\&#39;ve said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS &#34;Crime Time After Prime Time&#34; early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the &#34;monster&#34; he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being &#34;turned&#34; vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other\&#39;s lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight\&#39;s big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his &#34;gift&#34; of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John\&#39;s ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who\&#39;d lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn\&#39;t. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn\&#39;t even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has &#34;trust issues.&#34; She, from her perspective, gave him a &#34;gift&#34; of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little &#34;family&#34; (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice\&#39;s Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he &#34;does good&#34; as a PI because he feels guilty about the &#34;bad&#34; he\&#39;s done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl\&#39;s mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don\&#39;t kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother\&#39;s little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick\&#39;s distant &#34;relationship&#34; with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that\&#39;s not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox\&#39;s character Lucy edits on FX\&#39;s show Dirt, except it\&#39;s less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, &#34;No Such Thing as Vampires,&#34; Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn\&#39;t watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn\&#39;t watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS\&#39; web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O\&#39;Loughlin\&#39;s eye-candy good looks, I\&#39;ve always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring\&#39;s dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn\&#39;t about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O\&#39;Loughlin just takes over the screen when he\&#39;s on it because he\&#39;s got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O\&#39;Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O\&#39;Loughlin. She also isn\&#39;t your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl\&#39;s got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a &#34;real&#34; woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it\&#39;s set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, &#34;Eh, that was was pretty; I\&#39;ll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better.&#34; I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O\&#39;Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn\&#39;t expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I\&#39;d watch as &#34;webisodes&#34; and not much else.Surprisingly, it\&#39;s getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick\&#39;s ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It\&#39;s still eye candy, but I don\&#39;t feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O\&#39;Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we\&#39;re up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick\&#39;s happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick &#34;went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster&#34; has only improved the show\&#39;s &#34;grab&#34; factor. The chemistry between Alex O\&#39;Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there\&#39;s a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I\&#39;m looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It\&#39;s that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They\&#39;re still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not &#34;serious&#34; literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it\&#39;s not the genre that defines the shows, it\&#39;s the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they\&#39;re thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, &#34;No Such Thing As Vampires,&#34; and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.&#39;,
         &#39;Fellini it ain\&#39;t, but Burn Notice is a well made entertainment with watchable people and a snarky sense of humor. The story is about a fired American spy, who seems to have some lethal enemies up high, but the episodes are - well - episodic, as he takes on various violent jobs to make a living while trying to find out who did what to him in DC. In a sense, Burn Notice is a story about families - Donovan, his ex-girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar - very watchable and funny), and his best friend making up one family, the members of whom are always there for each other, though not without the resentments and egos of real family. In addition, Donovan also has a &#34;real&#34; family with whom he has issues - an annoying mother (Sharon Gless) and an irresponsible brother (whose character actually seems to develop over time.) The acting ranges from appropriately deadpan (the lead actor, Jeffrey Donovan, who is good here and was even better in the much mourned Touching Evil) to appropriately over-the-top (various villains.) Two objections: 1. The story is set in Miami, but there are no African-Americans. Why not? and 2: Why is Sharon Gless both under-used and confined to one whining note? She\&#39;s a good actress and could do so much more. Still, all in all, a winner in the light entertainment mode - light years better than so-called reality TV.&#39;,
         &#39;This is probably one of the greatest TV series ever made.  It lasted only two years but will be remembered far longer.  The first season covers the period of Ancient Rome from the split between Caesar and Pompey to the murder of Caesar on the senate floor.  The writing and acting is superb and was well thought out.  The creators learned about Roman History and paid attention to fact.  In addition they added two wonderful fictional characters based on real people who are barely known who bumble through the time period experiencing history first hand.  Attia is another character whom history has told us little about and she is fleshed out in the same way.  The fiction and fact meld into a facinating mix of storytelling.  I highly recommend this TV series.&#39;,
         &#34;HBO&#39;S ORIGINAL AND AWESOME FIRST SEASON OF ROME IS A STYLISTICALLY AWESOME SPECTACULAR SERIES.EACH AND EVERY EPISODE HOLDS EVERYTHING FROM INTRIGUE TO ENGAGING ACTION AND ADVENTURE ALONG WITH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS THAT GO FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS TO ALL-TIME LOWS. SOMETIMES BRUTAL AND GORY, THEN BEAUTIFUL AND TOUCHING, ROME STANDS ALONE AMONG HBO&#39;S NUMEROUS AND SOLID SERIES. AS SOPRANO&#39;S WANES, ROME GROWS IN STENGTH AND INTENSITY.HAVING JUST WATCHED THE FIRST 3 EPISODES OF SEASON 2 - WHICH IS JUST GETTING BETTER AND BETTER - I HAD TO PURCHASE SEASON 1.IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T WATCHED OR BOUGHT THIS AMAZING SERIES, THEN YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST. BELIEVE ME, YOU WON&#39;T BE SORRY.&#34;,
         &#39;&#34;Rome&#34; is almost like two different productions smashed together. One of them is a classic well-acted account of the politics and history of Rome in the days of Ceaser. The other production involves &#34;history of the common people&#34; and enough graphic sex \&#39;n violence to get a mass audience to watch it. The first production would get five stars from me but the other would get one star. So in the end, it gets three.At the top of the production, there is an excellent cast playing out the classical story of Julius Ceaser from the point where he decided to return from Gaul to his assasination in the senate. The portrayal of Ceaser is incredible. Its really able to get across the concern about what Ceaser\&#39;s intentions really are and how he is using everyone around him. The other characters in the civil war are equally well done. Pompey is rightfully portrayed as Ceaser\&#39;s equal rather than a fool or a loser. The personalities of Mark Anthony and a very young Octavian perfectly set up the inevitability of what is to come. The only character whose portrayal fails is Brutus. Rather than an idealistic leading man of Rome, Brutus is written as an immature fool. The writers were obsessed with making Brutus the scorned illegitimate child of Ceaser and explaining everything about the historical character from that point of view. It doesn\&#39;t work at least for me.Attached to the production is a modernistic &#34;everyman&#34; history in the form of two soldiers. They are supposed to weave into the plot to show the lives of everyday romans. But for me, it doesn\&#39;t really work. They are inserted into key events in every episode in really clumsey ways. Having one of them trigger the civil war and then later be the actual father of Ceasar\&#39;s child by Cleopatra is just silly. There is also an adultery plot that runs the entire season that just isn\&#39;t very interesting. It would have been better to ditch the two everyman and bring in character actors for single episodes to play the roles that common people might play in the plot. Both actors are excellent though. They are actually playing far above the material they are being given.Nobody can deny that violence was a part of Roman life. Where the production gets it wrong however is when it does &#34;look at me&#34; sorts of sex and violence that don\&#39;t in any real way advance the plot and are just there to draw in a certain kind of audience.The accurancy of its portrayal of ordinary Roman life is up for question anyway. The reason most productions on rome focus on the top layer of society is that we have books from the period written about those people. We don\&#39;t have much as far as accounts of common rome go and all too often, archelogy combined with imagination gets substituted for solid history. And all too often, the view of sexuality in roman society is based on a couple writers who wrote tabloid style scandal material either for the political opponents of the elite or for the people in every age who consume such things.Properly edited down, &#34;Rome&#34; would be a first-class production. As it is, like most of the material funded by HBO its flawed by an attempt to draw in a bigger audience through salting in lots of sex \&#39;n violence.&#39;,
         &#39;Rome makes I, Claudius look like a walk in the park on a sunny afternoon.  Rome pulls out all the stops and show everything in full splendor and gore:  sex, violence, torture, slavery, execution, adultery, orgies--you name it.  This is not for the squeamish; this is full-on history in all of its gory glory.  Great performances abound from Polly Walker, Ray Stevenson and Ciaran Hinds in particular.&#39;],

        [&#34;This series revolves around 4 friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and who go through a variety of difficult but extremely funny and often extravagant situations. I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend&#39;s grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy.&#34;,
         &#39;I was pleasantly surprised with this &#34;out of the box&#34; series.  Good writing, good acting, laugh out loud situations.  Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he\&#39;s always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It\&#39;s basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations.  What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful.  It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg&#39;,
         &#34;The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you&#39;ll find on television. It&#39;s fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don&#39;t think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it&#39;s more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer&#39;s friends are killed or attacked and he&#39;s out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it&#39;s not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can&#39;t recommend buying this season enough (thought why there&#39;s not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it&#39;s a couple years old now, but it&#39;s still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you&#39;ll find anywhere.&#34;,

         &#39;Friends - The Complete Tenth Season is the last in the show\&#39;s amazing 10-year run. The last season was the shortest as well, only 18 episodes. Some of the episodes are funny and entertaining and some are not. Season 10 is a mixed bag, you can tell the writers really started running out of ideas. The series finale is incredibly moving and spoiler alert! Ross and Rachel finally get back together (they are so meant to be, seriously!). Monica and Chandler finally get a baby, well twins actually. Phoebe gets married to Mike and Joey well he\&#39;s character went on to star in an unsuccessful spin-off. It was time these &#34;friends&#34; went their separate ways but at least fans like me can watch these DVD\&#39;s anytime, enjoy!&#39;,
         &#34;I thought that THE SOPRANOS was going to be HBO&#39;s greatest show, but it started to become very tedious after the fourth season. Then ROME came along and in just 2 seasons, it made me forget entirely about THE SOPRANOS. This is just a brilliant show filled with great performances, great dialogue, great direction... but this is not your parents&#39; Charlton Heston or Elizabeth Taylor epic. This is a brutal, gritty, vulgar, sexy and realistic portrayal of those who lived in these times as presented to our time.Many deserve accolades for their work insofar as performances are concerned like Ciaran Hinds as the frighteningly human Julius Caesar, James Purefoy as the bawdy Marc Antony, the delicious Polly Walker as Atia, the radiant Kerry Condon as Octavia... but the real accolades go to Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson, as the proud but flawed Lucius Vorenus and the lusty, violent Titus Pullo, respectively. It is their relationship that is at the the core of this show, and as much as the political and emotional intrigue of the series is fascinating, I find myself longing for a show that was just about the relationship and adventures of Vorenus and Pullo. Their friendship has a very mismatched-buddy-cop chemistry, but in a form of entertainment that has exhausted that cliche, it really works between these two. They play off each other wonderfully, and individually, they&#39;re terrific. I can only hope that this show will, in the future, be as or more respected and revered as THE SOPRANOS.&#34;,
         &#39;I really looked forward to seeing some of what looked like an epic historical series based on the Roman empire, but what I ended seeing was a lot of violence and sex, and that seems to be the major draw of the series.  Of course, a genuine Roman history buff might appreciate it more, and this series does have a certain epic quality about it.I could even cope with Romans speaking with British accents (what are British actors supposed to speak with?) if I had actually found a character or two to care about.  It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal, and maybe that\&#39;s the way Rome was, but after sitting through the first episode of this first season, I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I\&#39;m sure Rome will go on without me, and my best advice is to find a way to &#34;try before you buy&#34; and plunk down a lot of money to find it\&#39;s not what you expected.&#39;],

        [&#39;This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \&#39;prayer of the bone&#34; which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\&#39;t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\&#39;s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.&#39;,
         &#39;While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn\&#39;t like his character and wasn\&#39;t sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O\&#39;Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only &#34;knock&#34; I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren\&#39;t quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn\&#39;t appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.&#39;,
         &#39;It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd\&#39;s murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs\&#39; service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs\&#39; past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  &#34;NCIS: The Third Season&#34; is very highly recommended to fans of the series.&#39;,

         &#39;Ever since the crew of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise signed off at the end of &#34;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&#34;, the film franchise had taken a nosedive.  Besides &#34;First Contact&#34;, all the subsequent films only served to facilitate the demise of the franchise, with &#34;Nemesis&#34; seemingly the final shovel-full of dirt into the coffin.  With the &#34;Original Series&#34; cast gone, the franchise (at least in terms of box office and TV ratings, not fanboys like me who will watch it regardless of popularity!) slowly died away.However, after young director J.J. Abrams began building a name for himself with such projects as &#34;Alias&#34;, &#34;LOST&#34;, and &#34;Cloverfield&#34;, he decided to tackle the challenge of making Star Trek relevant again to today\&#39;s audiences.  By and large Abrams accomplished that goal with flying colors, although not without a few hiccups along the way:The Good:-Since the &#34;Original Series&#34; characters are still (some 40+ years removed from their show) the heart of the Star Trek franchise (people don\&#39;t flock to conventions to see Scott Bakula!), Abrams resurrects them in this film by showing them in their early years of space exploration.  This proves to be the biggest success of the film, as nods to TOS abound throughout the movie.  Since those are the characters we care the most about, we hang on the edge of our seats to see a young Captain Kirk get a little feisty, a young Spock raise that eyebrow, or a young Leonard &#34;Bones&#34; McCoy utter his trademark grumbly phrases.-Along with the time-period (pre-TOS) choice, the casting is also spot-on.  On can easily imagine Chris Pine growing into the Kirk popularized by William Shatner, while Zachary Quinto also portrays a very believable Spock.  Perhaps the most fun character in the film to watch, though, isKarl Urban as the cantankerous (even at a young age!) Bones.  The actors playing the characters of Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, and Sulu also turn in performances that easily harken back to their TOS predecessors.  An appearance from old hand Leonard Nimoy (which turns out to be a lot more than just a cameo!) also fits right in to the flow of the film, not seeming forced or desperate.The Bad:-The main plot of the film, which involves time-travel.  While I won\&#39;t spoil the entire plot in this review, suffice it to say that trying to figure out all the nuances of the plot is like trying to pin down Season Five of LOST...you can try all you want, but since time-travel is (at best) a theoretical concept, you will not succeed.  Too many times during the viewing of this film did I find myself wondering &#34;huh?&#34;.-Though promised a villain, in Nero, to be the equal of Captain Kirk, instead we get a character with much less development than Shinzon from &#34;Nemesis&#34;.  The best of the Star Trek movies (besides part IV) have all featured villains (Khan, Klingons, Borg, etc.) that are just as interesting as the protagonists.  Though Eric Bana plays the role of Nero as best he can, there just isn\&#39;t enough (any?!) character development to make him a viable and interesting villain.All in all, although this Star Trek reboot did a few things wrong, it still did many more things right.  I compare it to &#34;Batman Begins&#34;, where all the nods to previous Batman films were &#34;gotten out of the system&#34; and thus the franchise could move forward to create the remarkable &#34;Dark Knight&#34;.  I can see the EXACT same thing happening to this Star Trek reboot.  Though some Trekkies may be a bit peeved at the ending, it still (one way or another) paves the road for (hopefully!) many more Star Trek adventures to come!&#39;,
         &#39;I watched this twice, to make sure I really got it and to test my perceptions of it.  The first time, I watched it in big blocks of three hours over consecutive days and got very tired of it, kind of waiting to get to Caesar\&#39;s assassination for it to end.  The second time, I watched each episode separated by a few days, and it was much much better that way.  Like all good films, I saw much more and am sure that it will get even better with subtleties and nuance on repeated viewings.The plot follows Caesar as he ends the Gallic War, crosses the Rubicon as a revolutionary (or demagogue or psychopath or whatever), and becomes dictator, ending with his murder.  However, rather than a single character, such as Claudius in I Claudius, the story omnisciently follows several lives of those revolving around Caesar.  You have aristocrats (supporters and opponents), soldiers, and the normal riff-raff of Rome.  In many ways, the main character really is Rome itself, as Caesar is at best a shadowy figure, while the others appear and reappear suddenly.The principal characters are the honorable Centurion Vorenus and his troublesome sidekick, the brutal legionnaire  Pullo.  They are entirely fictional, and while the actors that portray them are very good, they came off as a bit of a plot device, to get the viewer into certain places and to illustrate things that were occurring.  They pop up in Caesar\&#39;s last major Gallic battle, scramble for work in ROme, join Caesar\&#39;s civil war effort in Greece and Egypt, then return to seek new careers in Rome.  They stumble across Pompey, Cleopatra, and Octavian (the future Augustus), all the while rather oblivious to the true meaning of events unfolding around them, even though Vorenus becomes a Senator.  That being said, the intrigues that weave their way through the story are quite fun, and while embellished as all historical fiction must be, accurate in the outline of events as we know them.  You also have the aristocrats (actual historical figures, though with added fictional details) of Atia and Servilia; they are mortal enemies, both connected to Caesar and intriguers that are as cold as they come.I did not need to watch this to learn the history, though it would definitely be good for that.  For me, the greatest pleasure is the painstaking accuracy of the portrayal of Rome and life at that time.  The viewer is served a host of wonderful images, vivid colors, and very well drawn characters.  You can not only smell Rome, but feel the chaos and fear that convulsed the city at this time.  Then there is the manner in which people lived, evocations of their non-Christian religious beliefs and rituals, the conditions in which slaves lived, and the character of the Roman aristocrat, who would resignedly accept death for the sake of honor or as the price for risking political gain.  It is truly wonderful, and the bonus disk has excellent mini-documentaries that explain much of it.  (I did find inaccuracies, such as the claim that &#34;anything goes&#34; sexually - the Romans were notorious homophobes, for example - but these were very few.)Warmly recommended.  While the story and drama are not as tight as in I Claudius, it is an absolutely first-rate evocation of a vanished world.&#39;,
         &#39;Very few television series can boast that they have been blessed with the greatest production values ever, as well has having a remarkable cast and crew that knew they were making something for generations of people to enjoy. &#34;Rome&#34; is one such series. A huge ratings winner when it was first broadcast on HBO, the series is set in Ancient Rome and deals with the death of Mark Antony, as well as Ancient Rome\&#39;s transition from Republic to Empire, and Caesar\&#39;s Invasion of Gaul. The backdrop of the story deals with the beautiful heterosexual relationship of two soldiers, Lucius and Titus, who find their lives intertwined and who basically fight for each other, at times often to the point of risking their own lives. What I have always admired &#34;Rome&#34; for is its depiction of how close it came in presenting itself as a series that actually looks like a theatrical release. The budget was probably the highest for any series and it shows on the screen. From the sets to the costumes, the producers were not shy in their attempt in bringing viewers back to a time in European history that many did not know much about, except for those who excelled in history while in grade school or college. This set comes with 12 episodes housed in a splendid DVD case made out of thick, strong cardboard that protects the dics. The set also comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary, interviews with the cast and crew, and so much more. Add this set to your DVD archive as you will view it over and over. A second season is also available, either in a stand alone set or the &#34;Complete Rome DVD Set&#34;. Talk is a feature film is in post production with many of the original cast and crew already signed.&#39;],

        [&#34;4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend. I laughed. Often. At things that aren&#39;t supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain&#39;t comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won&#39;t. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one&#39;s always hittin&#39; homers, even on comedy &#39;roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There&#39;s a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it&#39;s often in good ways.If you don&#39;t like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.&#34;,
         &#39;Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles.  I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek.  This is the season with the &#34;homos on the train&#34; line.&#39;,
         &#39;this is one of those individualistic and remarkable films that for some reason has slipped under or past the usual critical and viewer recommendations -- hat tip to a.o. scott for highlighting it as a critic\&#39;s choice in the new york times. &#34;friends of eddie coyle&#34; is in that peculiar variant of film noir where &#34;good and evil&#34; have been entirely extracted from the narrative dynamic, leaving only the tactical calculations of characters swimming a turbulent world of existentialist gray. it only gradually becomes clear that some of these low lifes are thieves, some are gun runners, and some are cops, or how exactly the thieves and gun runners are connected, or that acquaintances are hit men, and hit men will, for a price, take down even those they invite to enjoy a hockey game. the narrative shifts back and forth between set piece bank robberies or gun purchases and one on one conversations in which the protagonists alternately manipulate, flatter, wheedle, bluff, coerce or inform on one another -- all filmed in a flat, clinical, procedural style strongly reminiscent jean-pierre melville\&#39;s &#34;army of shadows&#34; (1969). the whole is knit together by the fate of eddie coyle, embodied by robert mitchum in an unsentimental but nuanced performance, who attempts to balance the demands of treasury cops (who might help him in a forthcoming sentencing for smuggling liquor) and the needs of armed criminals (who provide eddie\&#39;s livelihood). the film is a grim and tragic examination of human beings who must negotiate trust and threat as part of their daily survival, and where the winners are those who can do the most reliable service for &#34;the man&#34; (or for &#34;uncle&#34;); the weak are those who only have the weak to rely on.&#39;,

         &#34;Ryan Gosling is among my favorite actors and I thought he was brilliant as the bizarre David Marks.I did not like this movie probably because it&#39;s based on a true story and it&#39;s very disturbing andalarming.  I thought Kirsten Dunst was okay and Lily Rabe was excellent.  Having researched this storybefore watching the film, I still was not prepared for how difficult emotionally I would find it to be.&#34;,
         &#39;Solomon Kane is a man who\&#39;s sworn an oath of peace after living a life of constantly being in battle and killing. He was an incredibly evil man. Along the way, his soul became damned and now the devil wants him to pay his dues. When Kane decides he isn\&#39;t quite ready to go to hell, the devil unleashes his &#34;children&#34; out upon the earth to wreak havoc. Kane\&#39;s oath and the religious marks on his body are the only things keeping him in hiding, but his oath is put to the test when a family who has taken him in is endangered by &#34;the man with no face&#34; and his henchmen.Ever wonder what it would be like if Van Helsing didn\&#39;t suck? To take that idea a bit further, ever wonder what it would be like if the films Van Helsing and Constantine were able to mate and its offspring was a film that was actually pretty awesome? In a nutshell, that\&#39;s what you get with Solomon Kane. On the surface, Solomon Kane is very similar to Van Helsing. It has the same look and atmosphere of Van Helsing without all the monster hunting. In place of the monsters, we get demons. That\&#39;s where the Constantine influence comes in. Solomon Kane\&#39;s religious undertones, use of mirrors, and conclusion are all very reminiscent of Constantine.Certain elements of the film may not be as absorbing as others. The CGI in the film seemed to fluctuate between being pretty good to below par. The crucifixion scene didn\&#39;t really work either. Why Kane did what he did in that scene makes sense, but his actions and what he does immediately after that is pretty hard to swallow.Solomon Kane isn\&#39;t without its flaws, but is basically the gory, more adult, and definitive version of what Van Helsing should have been. With the amount of decapitated heads that are rolling around, every action scene littered with splattered blood, and its darker twists on religious views, Solomon Kane delivers a blood-soaked cinematic delight.&#39;,
         &#34;Solomon Kane (Michael J. Bassett, 2009)Been sitting on this Solomon Kane review for a lot longer than usual; I&#39;m writing this on December 14, 2010, and I actually watched the movie back on October 16. I kept putting it off, trying to come up with something compelling to say about this movie, but a couple of days ago I realized that was never going to happen there is nothing compelling about this movie. It&#39;s a Sci-Fi Channel original on steroids and with marginally better production values, but it&#39;s basically a Sci-Fi Channel original Movie nonetheless.Solomon Kane (Resident Evil&#39;s James Purefoy) is a former mercenary who, after the particularly vicious sacking of a town, loses his soul to the devil. As a result, he renounces his life of violence and retires to seclusion in a monastery in the remote countryside. All well and good until the monks decide that, given the state of his soul, he&#39;s too much of a threat to keep around. They toss him out on his ear, and while traveling, he falls in with a band of merry travelers, the Crowthorns. Father William (The Usual Suspects&#39; Pete Postlethwaite) is a caring sort who scoops Kane up off the road whilst he&#39;s injured and unconscious, and as he recovers, he gets to be friends with the rambunctious son, Samuel (Patrick Hurd-Wood, real-life brother to Rachel), and there&#39;s some hefty sexual tension with the daughter, Meredith (said Rachel, recently of An American Haunting). All goes well, again, except that, you know, the devil is on his tail, and he must eventually realize that pacifism is probably not the way to go in the face of so implacable a foe (and said foe&#39;s henchmen).The most impressive thing about this flick, hands down, is the cast. I didn&#39;t mention Max von Sydow, who plays Kane&#39;s father, though he generally looks lost during his two minutes or so of screen time. Nor Alice Krige as the matron of the Crowthorns, and Alice Krige, like Pete Postlethwaite, is always a welcome sight on a screen. Or Jason Flemyng, perhaps the least-known, but most talented, of the stable Guy Ritchie made Lock Stock... and Snatch with (a group that has given us, among others, Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones). Philip Winchester (Camelot). Ryan James (The Illusionist). The list goes on. There is a heavy load of acting talent to be found here. And collectively it does the best it can with a tired script, adapted by Bassett from source by Robert E. Howard.Do people never learn? Has there, to date, been a single decent movie adapted from Howard&#39;s work? (Let me help you out with that one: no.) Tto flicks, two TV series, and four video games, and no one&#39;s figured out how to do Conan the Barbarian right yet. And we&#39;ll not even mention Red Sonja except in passing. (But we have to pause and snigger at Kull the Conqueror, which at least revels in its awfulness.) You have to blame this, at least partly, on the slavish devotion people seem to feel to Howard&#39;s work; no one is willing to update away the archaic attitudes, take into account differences in expected pacing then and now, that sort of thing.Don&#39;t get me wrong, in the world of Howard adaptations, it&#39;s clearly the best of a bad lot, and if you&#39;re looking for a generic actioner with supernatural elements, you can do a whole lot worse than this. But classic cinema it is not, and from the gushing of some reviewers, you might be expecting it. ***&#34;],

        [&#39;I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the &#34;cozy&#34; mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.&#39;,
         &#34;What is there to say about NCIS?LGG..slappin the back of peoples&#39;s heads.Abby..man what a great show.I watch this every Tuesday night,though Los Angles is better.&#34;,
         &#34;The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I&#39;m from Massachusetts. Mitchum&#39;s accent isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it&#39;s no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins&#39; best crime novel. I&#39;ve never read it. Don&#39;t expect today&#39;s production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing.&#34;,
         ...,
         &#34;It must have been deliberate.  Pierce Brosnan, of all people, looks like Stephen King in this adaptation of his novel!  The novel was one of King&#39;s best because he managed at long last to combine a horror story with a love story.  Love stories prior to this had pretty much eluded him although he tried. The tv show is rendered in much broader and bolder strokes than the novel.  There is always that tendency in screen adaptations of novels though.The scary stuff is plenty scary.  There is ghost after ghost in creepy rendition after creepy rendition.  If you are in the mood for horror, this is the tv show for you.The protagonist&#39;s wife is killed  in traffic while he is at a book signing.  He is devastated and retreats to their lakeside home in Maine. There he begins to wonder if his wife was seeing someone else.  He also meets someone new but she is locked in a custody battle with her child&#39;s rich paternal grandfather. It turns out to be a lot more complex problem though than an affair or a custody battle.  There is a mystery going back to his grandfather&#39;s generation which affected a circle of young men from the 1930s.King&#39;s best screen adaptations were Kubrick&#39;s THE SHINING starring Jack Nicholson, Rob Reiner&#39;s STAND BY ME with the late River Phoenix, Christopher Walken starring in his DEAD ZONE, Kathy Bates in her Oscar winning role with James Caan in MISERY and Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in CARRIE. Those are pretty lofty standards for others to try to meet.  That is heavyweight film talent. They are all either Oscar winners or Oscar nominees. So doing it on tv with a good actor, but hardly a Walken, Caan or Nicholson, gives this less of a chance right from the start.  BAG OF BONES is a good job but it is not up there with these now classic five star films.&#34;,
         &#39;Robert E. Howard\&#39;s most celebrated swordsman is indisputably Conan the Barbarian, but just because the brooding Cimmerian towers above the rest of Howard\&#39;s sword &amp; sorcery pulp heroes doesn\&#39;t mean these other characters aren\&#39;t worth a look. Two such strapping blokes immediately come to mind: Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane. In his brief span of life Howard imagined some truly dark heroes, but none more dark and bleak than this morose 17th Century Puritan. Solomon Kane is the most complex character Howard would construct.His soul damned for past acts of murder and rapacity, Solomon Kane now strives for redemption, has embarked on a life of peace and non-violence. But when darkness once more stalks the land, Kane must take up his sword and his genius for gristly battle. He dons that trademark big-brimmed Puritan\&#39;s slouch hat. We learn how he ends up with that hat. This, after all, is his origin story.It\&#39;s a polished, top drawer production, I\&#39;ll tell the world. Most tellingly, Writer / Director Michael J. Bassett manages to capture onscreen the dark atmosphere so rife in those Solomon Kane exploits published many decades ago in WEIRD TALES, the classic pulp magazine. Solomon Kane, seeking salvation, negotiates a terrifying world inhabited by infernal forces. The sole bright spot in this damned man\&#39;s life manifests in the shape of a traveling Puritan family that takes in an injured Kane. The viewer will have seen this coming: It\&#39;s inevitable that Solomon Kane\&#39;s dark nature would render these good people vulnerable to predation from fiendish powers. Kane remarks to the family\&#39;s patriarch: &#34;My soul is damned. Satan\&#39;s creatures would take me should I stray from the path of peace.&#34; Me, I would\&#39;ve tore the hell out of there, upon hearing such confession. Except, in the wake of impending tragedy, Solomon Kane at last sees a way to undamn his soul. Save the cheerlea- er, save the Puritan girl... save the world.James Purefoy assumes a dour demeanor and is magnificent, breathing life and dimension into the grim Puritan. The crucial moment was always gonna be how convincing Purefoy would look once we see him in that black cloak and big hat and wielding the sword and blasting away with his brace of flintlock pistols. It\&#39;s gratifying to see Purefoy pulling it off so well. I don\&#39;t know that I\&#39;ve ever seen him in action roles before, but he is a natural. He certainly has the physical presence. He cleaves thru bone and gristle with bloody conviction. Tell me it\&#39;s not a brilliant moment of assownery when Purefoy surrenders his vow of peace and growls to Satan\&#39;s minions: &#34;If I kill you, I am bound for Hell. It is a price I shall gladly pay.&#34;SOLOMON KANE is graced with a solid supporting cast that includes Max Von Sydow, a sense of desolation that drives the mood, eye-catching compositions and sleek special effects (love the scene in which demons erupt from the mirrors), and an intense James Purefoy. Michael J. Bassett\&#39;s hope is that this is the first in an epic trilogy, and he really is off to a fantastic start. The Puritan\&#39;s work is still far from done. To quote the damn fugly witch in this movie: &#34;All the Devil\&#39;s children are free to walk the earth now.&#34; But the Devil\&#39;s children would do well not to bump into men with big buckled hats and somber dispositions.The DVD\&#39;s bonus material: The Making of SOLOMON KANE featurette (00:04:23 minutes long); interviews with actors James Purefoy, Pete Postlethwaite, Max Von Sydow, Rachel Hurd-Wood, and director Michael J. Bassett; clips from the film - note that these aren\&#39;t deleted or extended scenes (00:05:42); the trailer; and &#34;B-Roll,&#34; which basically is behind-the-scenes footage (00:20:01).&#39;,
         &#39;Solomon Kane stars James Purefoy as a pirate of royal blood, who\&#39;s soul is damned for hell (literally!) and becomes a self-made holy man. Now, one heck of a story could be told about this man, however this is not a character study. Instead this is another CGI over substance wonder, this one coming from Great Briain instead of Hollywood, that\&#39;s a novelty I suppose.Based on the works of Robert E. HowardConan - The Complete Questthis is another tale of &#34;witchcraft and sorcery&#34;, this tale begins in 1600 with Solomon working as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth 1 in North Africa, here he meets a demon who tries to take possession of his soul, it\&#39;s no longer his, but property of the devil. Solomon escapes, or the movie would be a lot shorter. Once back in England he gives up his evil ways, seeks sanctuary at a church and begins a life of peace, intending to live out his days their. I guess that wasn\&#39;t in god\&#39;s plan, as one day, the priests boot Solomon out, I think he got until sundown to leave, because he was out of their fast.Solomon\&#39;s plan seems to be to wonder the Earth, you know like Caine in Kung Fu, first day out he\&#39;s besieged by a band of robbers who look escapes from one of those horror films about a family of cannibals. He\&#39;s beaten and robbed, of what I\&#39;m not sure, because of his unwillingness to lay his murderer\&#39;s hands upon anyone anymore.He\&#39;s saved from death by a puritan family (Alice Krige and the late Pete Postelwait),their daughter Margaret (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and son Samuel (Patrick Hurd-Wood), who nurse him back to health, befriend him and give him a silly looking quaker costume.It takes nearly forty minutes to get the core of the story which comes after the family is mercilessly butcher by emissaries of the sorcerer Malicah (Jason Flemying), Margaret survives, but is abducted. Now, the sleeping beast Solomon Kane was has been awakened. Malicah, has imprisoned the people of the land, stolen the throne and has his minions turned into scared brutes. Solomon Kane, as it turns it, is the second son in the line to the throne (Howard had some belief hereos had to be of some sort of noble blood), banished years earlier by his father (Max Von Sydow), he may not have expected  a happy homecoming, but not this.Solomon Kane is s good looking production, good actors, costumes, make-up, cinematography, locations. It does sufer under the weight of it\&#39;s terrible dialogue that sounds as if it was lifted directly from Howard\&#39;s writing, someone actually says &#34;silence you dogs&#34; and Solomon states &#34;I am the only devil here&#34;, I think you get the idea. I suspect that this movie will draw some comparison with last summer\&#39;s dudJonah Hex, it is better than that, in some ways I was reminded of Bergamsn\&#39;sThe Seventh Seal: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray], and not just because of Von Sydow\&#39;s cameo, and not because this is great art, but certain plot elements and a tiny bit of it\&#39;s thematic structure. This in itself, I think makes it a more interesting movie.It is well known that the film has, as of yet, to find a distributor in North America, it was released theatrically in England and parts of Europe where it did poorly. It is hard to say, especially in this filmgoing climate if this is theatrical worthy. I know I liked it better than a lot of what is playing at multiplexies, however it does have a syfy channel ready approach to it, some of the CGI is not so great, Solomon Kane was shot on a budget of $45 million, not $250 million like the latest Transformers movie.  Also, today such high exposure stars as Al Pacino, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, William Hurt, Dustin Hoffman, Nick Nolte find themselves working on HBO, filmmakers like Michael Mann, Todd Philips, Paul Schrader, Curtis Hnasen, and soon, David Mamet have all directed cable movies. I find Solomon Kane to be worth a look, but where to look at it and how hard to look at it, that\&#39;s another tale to tell.&#39;],

        [&#39;I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch &#34;grown up&#34; television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime.&#39;,
         &#39;It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.&#39;,
         &#34;Season 2 of It&#39;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia is mandatory for anyhow who watches the show to own. This season has some of the greatest episodes in Sunny history!&#34;,
         ...,
         &#34;It&#39;s been a very long time since I was actually excited about a TV show. Usually, shows I watch just sort of reach a level of pleasant/better than the majority of crap that&#39;s out there. Continuum has virtually everything I love in a good show though. Strong female lead, witty sidekick, great worldbuilding, believable action within the universe that they&#39;ve created, sympathetic villains, a plot and issues that go beyond solving the week&#39;s case, and tight writing. I can&#39;t wait until this is available in the States. I will buy as many seasons as come out and try to support the show as best I can. Quality programming, writing, acting.**I should add that after watching the pilot, I went and watched the entirety of season 1 (all 10 episodes) in under two days. I just couldn&#39;t stop myself. It&#39;s that good.&#34;,
         &#39;When comparing books to their movie counterparts I think most people need a reality check. It is not possible to stuff 450 pages into a 2 hour movie. Period.The filmmaker/screenwriter seeks to take the essence of the novel and use prime scenes from it to create a good adaptation.In the case of John Dies At The End, it should be obvious to anyone who had previously read the book that the film would not and could not contain even half of the elements/scenes therein.Having said that I really enjoyed the film as a film. I am a big fan of Don Coscarelli, so the combination of Coscarelli and writer &#34;David Wong&#34; for this movie is a win-win scenario.The acting is good, pacing is good and the effects range from excellent to b-movie style, which is fine by me.So get yer dose of soy sauce and download this movie, you will not be disappointed.&#39;,
         &#34;No monster Dave??!?!?  Really?!??!  That&#39;s, like, sort of the entire point of JDATE.  Sure, JDATE is full of exposition for the rest of the series, and it&#39;s also hilarious, strange, and terrifying.  But the big payoff in JDATE is the fact that Dave is NOT Dave by the end!  Why even bother with the axe story in the beginning if they&#39;re not going to use it for a reason?The lack of monster Dave is not the only problem with this adaptation.  Many characters, plot lines, and locations were cut.  The final product is a mishmash of scenes that don&#39;t make sense.  I can&#39;t even care about this movie.  I certainly don&#39;t care about the characters or plot.  It&#39;s disgusting that such fantastic source material could yield such an abomination.John was good, though.&#34;],

        [&#34;This one is a real snoozer. Don&#39;t believe anything you read or hear, it&#39;s awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you.&#34;,
         &#39;Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable.&#39;,
         &#34;It beats watching a blank screen. However, I just don&#39;t seem to be in tune with to comedy of today.&#34;,
         ...,
         &#39;A very good end to the Eleventh Doctor as portrayed by Matt Smith. I liked that story points from the very first Matt Smith episode were tied up. A good story, fast regeneration. Worth watching multiple times.&#39;,
         &#34;This episode tied up a lot of loose plot lines, such as what were The Silence trying to prevent, what happened to Gallifrey and could the Doctor ever stay in one place.Conversely, this episode was on occasion offensive. I don&#39;t care that the town is called Christmas. But going to church naked, along with a few other Christian jabs on a holiday special was not appropriate - nor were they funny.I liked the plot lines and explanations, but I didn&#39;t like much else. And my children were well behaved so that they could watch the Dr. Who Christmas special online with me.&#34;,
         &#34;And if you read the novel, you know this a &amp;#34;thinking&amp;#34; piece that stimulates reflection, so if you aren&#39;t motivated by that description, you will find it extremely boring.  I didn&#39;t.  Jeremy Irons played his part perfectly.  The movie actually helped me understand the novel more.&#34;],

        [&#34;I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn&#39;t appeal to me at all.&#34;,
         &#39;This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up. The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great. I had the best laughter I have had in a long time.&#39;,
         &#34;Not bad.  Didn&#39;t know any of the comedians but first time viewing put a smile on my face.  I&#39;ll check out the next season soon.&#34;,
         ...,
         &#34;I&#39;m not real sure on how, I should rate this series just yet since it&#39;s only the first episode. So I&#39;m going with 3 stars until I see other episodes to help support my opinion on if it&#39;s really good or not(right now it&#39;s just ok). I will come back and update once I&#39;ve seen more series. Now, when the movie takes off in the air plane scene, I thought I was in the movie myself. It start out like it&#39;s going to become a good apocalypse series, zombies , zombies I hope it will be worth they while. I will agree with another viewer who said, you get that cheap feel in between scenes something you&#39;ve seen before. In order to keep the audience interesting there needs to be less talking about garbage (that can get boring ) more action/fear.  So far so good, the series seems to be just ok until further notice I&#39;ll be back to update. I&#39;m waiting people this isn&#39;t my final review.&#34;,
         &#34;episode one so far makes me want to watch more. Reminds me of Salem&#39;s Lot in a way, and that is good. The accents are a bit much here and there, but looking forward to more!&#34;,
         &#34;I watched the pilot.  I guess I&#39;ve just seen too many horror movies.  When I was watching this it seemed to mimic other films I have seen in the past.  Each scene that was supposed to be shocking, I had seen done in other movies; one way or another.  That is why my rating was only three stars.  I may have paid to watch the pilot, but I doubt I will pay again to watch the remaining episodes.&#34;],

<p>teniendo en cuenta los resultados de los puntos podemos decir que los comentarios fueron en su mayoria positivos, ya que mas de la mitad de los comentarios tienen como puntuacion 4.0 y 5.0, por otro lado, el dia que mas comentarios tuvo es el domingo, yo pensaria que esto pasa por que las personas tienen mas tiempo de escribir sus reseñas este dia ya que es un dia que no se "trabaja" o estudia, respecto a los meses podriamos decir que la gente compra mas (debido a la cantidad de comentarios) a principio de año que finales del año y por ultimo con respecto al incremento del porcentaje de comentarios podemos decir que siempre hay mas comentarios respecto al año pasado, ya que los porcentajes son positivios, si fueran negativos significa que los comentarios disminuyen.</p>
